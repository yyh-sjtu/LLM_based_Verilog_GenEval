Sure! Based on the provided truth table, we can derive the logic expression for the output \( f \) by identifying which combinations of inputs produce a high output (1). 

From the truth table, we can see that the output \( f \) is 1 for the following combinations of inputs:

1. \( x3 = 0, x2 = 0, x1 = 0 \) (000)
2. \( x3 = 0, x2 = 0, x1 = 1 \) (001)
3. \( x3 = 0, x2 = 1, x1 = 1 \) (011)
4. \( x3 = 1, x2 = 1, x1 = 0 \) (110)

This corresponds to the minterms: 
- \( m0 \) (000)
- \( m1 \) (001)
- \( m3 \) (011)
- \( m6 \) (110)

The logical expression can be derived from these minterms:
\[ 
f = \overline{x3} \cdot \overline{x2} \cdot \overline{x1} + \overline{x3} \cdot \overline{x2} \cdot x1 + \overline{x3} \cdot x2 \cdot x1 + x3 \cdot x2 \cdot \overline{x1}
\]

This can be implemented in Verilog as follows:

```verilog
module truthtable (
    input x3,
    input x2,
    input x1,
    output f
);
    assign f = (~x3 & ~x2 & ~x1) |   // m0
               (~x3 & ~x2 & x1)  |   // m1
               (~x3 & x2 & x1)   |   // m3
               (x3 & x2 & ~x1);       // m6
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- `~` is the NOT operation, which inverts the value of the input.
- `&` is the AND operation.
- `|` is the OR operation.
- Each term in the expression corresponds to one of the minterms where \( f \) is 1.

This module takes three inputs, \( x3 \), \( x2 \), and \( x1 \), and produces one output \( f \) according to the specified truth table.
