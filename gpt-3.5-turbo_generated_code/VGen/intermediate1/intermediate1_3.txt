Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a half adder in Verilog. A half adder takes two single-bit binary inputs and produces two outputs: the sum and the carry output.

```verilog
// This is a half adder.
module half_adder(
    input a,      // Input a
    input b,      // Input b
    output cout,  // Carry output
    output sum    // Sum output
);

// Assigning outputs based on the logic of a half adder
assign sum = a ^ b;    // Sum is the XOR of the inputs
assign cout = a & b;   // Carry is the AND of the inputs

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The module has two inputs: `a` and `b`.
   - It has two outputs: `sum` and `cout` (carry output).

2. **Logic**:
   - The `sum` is calculated using the XOR operation (`a ^ b`), which gives the binary sum of the bits without considering carry.
   - The `cout` (carry output) is calculated using the AND operation (`a & b`), which indicates whether both inputs were `1`, thereby producing a carry.

### Usage:
To use the `half_adder` module, you would typically instantiate it in a higher-level module or testbench, providing the required input signal connections and observing the outputs.
