Sure! Below is a Verilog implementation of a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9. The counter increments on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`) when the `slowena` input is high. If the `reset` signal is activated, the counter resets to 0.

```verilog
module count_slow(
    input clk,
    input slowena,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Always block triggered by the rising edge of the clock
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        // Asynchronous reset
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 4'b0000;  // Reset q to 0
        end else if (slowena) begin
            // Increment the counter if slowena is high
            if (q == 4'b1001) begin
                q <= 4'b0000;  // Reset to 0 after reaching 9
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1;  // Increment the counter
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs:**
  - `clk`: Clock signal. The counter increments on the rising edge of this signal.
  - `slowena`: Enable signal that allows counting when high.
  - `reset`: Asynchronous reset signal to set the counter back to 0.
  
- **Output:**
  - `q`: 4-bit register to hold the current count value.

### Logic:
1. The counter checks for an `reset` condition first. If `reset` is high, it assigns `q` to `0`.
2. If `reset` is low and `slowena` is high, the counter increments. If it reaches 9 (i.e., `1001` in binary), it wraps around and resets to `0`.
3. The always block is sensitive to both the `clk` signal and the `reset` signal due to the `or` condition.
