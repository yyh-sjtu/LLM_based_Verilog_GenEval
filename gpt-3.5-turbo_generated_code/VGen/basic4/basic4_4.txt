Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog based on your specifications. The module takes two 5-bit inputs (`a` and `b`), a select signal (`sel`), and produces a 5-bit output (`out`). Depending on the value of `sel`, the output will either be `a` or `b`.

Hereâ€™s the Verilog code:

```verilog
// This is a 2-to-1 multiplexer.
module mux( 
    input [4:0] a,      // First input
    input [4:0] b,      // Second input
    input sel,          // Select signal
    output [4:0] out    // Output
);

    // Assigning output based on select line
    assign out = sel ? b : a;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `mux`, and it has inputs `a`, `b`, and `sel`, as well as the output `out`.
2. **Input/Output**: The inputs are declared as 5-bit wide (`[4:0]`), and the output is also declared as 5-bit wide.
3. **Behavior**: The `assign` statement uses a ternary operator to decide the value of `out`. If `sel` is `1`, `out` takes the value of `b`; if `sel` is `0`, `out` takes the value of `a`.

### Simulation and Testing
You would typically want to simulate this module to ensure it functions correctly. Here's an example of a simple testbench to verify your multiplexer works as intended:

```verilog
module tb_mux;

    reg [4:0] a;          // Test input a
    reg [4:0] b;          // Test input b
    reg sel;              // Test select signal
    wire [4:0] out;       // Output wire

    // Instantiate the mux module
    mux uut (
        .a(a),
        .b(b),
        .sel(sel),
        .out(out)
    );

    initial begin
        // Apply test cases
        a = 5'b10101; b = 5'b01010; sel = 0; // Expect out = a
        #10;
        if (out !== a) $display("Test failed when sel = 0, expected %b, got %b", a, out);
        else $display("Test passed when sel = 0, out = %b", out);

        sel = 1; // Change select to 1, expect out = b
        #10;
        if (out !== b) $display("Test failed when sel = 1, expected %b, got %b", b, out);
        else $display("Test passed when sel = 1, out = %b", out);

        // Include more test cases as needed
        #10;
        a = 5'b11111; b = 5'b00000; sel = 0; // Expect out = a
        #10;
        if (out !== a) $display("Test failed when sel = 0, expected %b, got %b", a, out);
        else $display("Test passed when sel = 0, out = %b", out);

        sel = 1; // Change select to 1, expect out = b
        #10;
        if (out !== b) $display("Test failed when sel = 1, expected %b, got %b", b, out);
        else $display("Test passed when sel = 1, out = %b", out);
        
        $finish; // End simulation
    end
endmodule
```

### Overview of the Testbench:
- The testbench (`tb_mux`) defines signals for inputs and outputs.
- It instantiates the `mux` module and drives test cases to verify the functionality of the multiplexer.
- A `#10` delay is added between test cases to allow time for the signals to propagate.
- The output is checked against the expected values, with a message printed indicating if the test passed or failed.

This will enable you to test the `mux` design functionality thoroughly.
