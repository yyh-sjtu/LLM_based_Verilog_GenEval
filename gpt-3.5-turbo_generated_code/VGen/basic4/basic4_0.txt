Sure, here is the implementation of the 2-to-1 multiplexer module in Verilog:

```verilog
module mux( 
  input [4:0] a, b,
  input sel,
  output reg [4:0] out );

  always @ (a, b, sel)
  begin
    if(sel)
      out = b;
    else
      out = a;
  end

endmodule
```

This module takes two 5-bit inputs `a` and `b`, a select signal `sel`, and has a 5-bit output `out`. It behaves as a 2-to-1 multiplexer where the output `out` is selected based on the value of the select signal `sel`. If `sel` is high (1), the output `out` will be the value of input `b`, else if `sel` is low (0), the output `out` will be the value of input `a`.
