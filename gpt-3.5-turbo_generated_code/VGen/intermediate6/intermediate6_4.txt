As a professional Verilog designer, I would implement the RAM module as requested:

```verilog
module ram #(
  parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 6,
  parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8
)
(
  input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data,
  input [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] addr,
  input we,
  input clk,
  output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] q
);

  reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] ram[2**ADDR_WIDTH-1:0];

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (we) begin
      ram[addr] <= data;
    end
    q <= ram[addr];
  end

endmodule
```

This Verilog module defines a RAM with a specified address width and data width. It has inputs for data, address, write enable signal, and clock. The output `q` provides the read data from the RAM. The RAM is implemented as an array where data is stored based on the address input. The write operation occurs on the rising edge of the clock based on the write enable signal, and the read operation is processed to output the data at the specified address.
