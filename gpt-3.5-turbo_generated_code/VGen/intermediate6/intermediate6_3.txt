Sure! Below is a complete implementation of a RAM module in Verilog, incorporating read and write operations based on the provided parameters for address width and data width. The `we` (write enable) signal is used to determine whether to write data to the RAM or read data from it.

```verilog
// This is a RAM module
module ram #( parameter ADDR_WIDTH=6, parameter DATA_WIDTH=8) (
    input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data,       // Data input
    input [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] addr,       // Address input
    input we,                           // Write enable
    input clk,                          // Clock input
    output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] q      // Data output
);
    // Memory array declaration
    reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] ram[0:(2**ADDR_WIDTH)-1]; // RAM array

    // Always block for write and read operations
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (we) begin
            ram[addr] <= data;         // Write data to RAM
        end
        q <= ram[addr];                // Read data from RAM
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Parameters:**
   - `ADDR_WIDTH`: Defines the width of the address bus.
   - `DATA_WIDTH`: Defines the width of the data bus.

2. **Inputs:**
   - `data`: The input data that will be written to the RAM.
   - `addr`: The address location in the RAM to write to or read from.
   - `we`: Write enable signal, which indicates whether to perform a write operation.
   - `clk`: A clock signal to synchronize the read and write operations.

3. **Output:**
   - `q`: The output data read from the RAM.

4. **Memory Declaration:**
   - The RAM is declared as an array of registers, where the size is determined by the `ADDR_WIDTH`.

5. **Always Block:**
   - On the rising edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`), the RAM performs either a write operation (if `we` is high) or a read operation.
   - If writing, the data at the specified address is updated.
   - Regardless of the write operation, the data at the address is read and assigned to output `q`.

This module can easily be instantiated and tested in a testbench to verify its functionality. Let me know if you need further details or examples!
