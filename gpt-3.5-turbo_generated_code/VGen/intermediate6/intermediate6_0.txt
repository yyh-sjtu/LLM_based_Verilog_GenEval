Sure! Below is the implementation of a simple synchronous RAM module in Verilog, according to your specifications. This code includes the essential functionality for reading from and writing to the RAM based on the input signals.

```verilog
// This is a RAM module
module ram #( 
    parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 6, // Number of address bits
    parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8  // Number of data bits
) (
    input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data,        // Input data
    input [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] addr,        // Address input
    input we,                           // Write enable
    input clk,                          // Clock signal
    output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] q       // Output data
);

    // Declare the RAM memory array
    reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] ram[2**ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]; 

    // Synchronous read and write
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (we) begin
            // Write data to the specified address
            ram[addr] <= data;
        end
        // Read data from the specified address
        q <= ram[addr];
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Parameters**: 
   - `ADDR_WIDTH`: The number of bits for the address lines; it determines the size of the RAM.
   - `DATA_WIDTH`: The number of bits for each data word stored in the RAM.

2. **Inputs**:
   - `data`: The data to be written into the RAM.
   - `addr`: The address at which to write/read the data.
   - `we`: A write enable signal that indicates if data should be written (when high).
   - `clk`: The clock signal that synchronizes the operations.

3. **Output**:
   - `q`: The data read from the RAM.

4. **Memory Declaration**: 
   - `ram` is a 2D array that acts as the memory, where each entry can hold a `DATA_WIDTH`-bit wide value.

5. **Behavior**:
   - On every rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`):
     - If `we` (write enable) is high, the `data` input is written to the `ram` at position `addr`.
     - Regardless of the write enable signal, the data at address `addr` is read from the memory and assigned to `q`.

This simple RAM module handles reading and writing in a synchronous manner, making it suitable for many applications in digital design. Adjust the parameters as needed for your specific use case or design constraints!
