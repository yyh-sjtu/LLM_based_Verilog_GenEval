Certainly! Let's implement the ABRO FSM (Finite State Machine) as you described. This FSM has four states and reacts to the inputs `a` and `b`, outputting `1` whenever both have been received, regardless of the order. 

Here's the complete Verilog implementation:

```verilog
module abro(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input a,
    input b,
    output reg z
);

// State definitions
parameter IDLE = 2'b00,
          SA   = 2'b01,
          SB   = 2'b10,
          SAB  = 2'b11;

// State registers
reg [1:0] cur_state, next_state;

// State transition logic
always @(*) begin
    case (cur_state)
        IDLE: begin
            if (a) 
                next_state = SA;
            else if (b)
                next_state = SB;
            else 
                next_state = IDLE;
        end
        SA: begin
            if (b) 
                next_state = SAB; // Transition to SAB if b is received
            else 
                next_state = SA; // Stay in SA if only a is high
        end
        SB: begin
            if (a) 
                next_state = SAB; // Transition to SAB if a is received
            else 
                next_state = SB; // Stay in SB if only b is high
        end
        SAB: begin
            // Once in SAB, we stay here until reset
            next_state = SAB;
        end
        default: next_state = IDLE; // Default case
    endcase
end

// Output logic
always @(*) begin
    if (cur_state == SAB) 
        z = 1;    // Output high when in SAB state
    else 
        z = 0;    // Output low otherwise
end

// State update logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) 
        cur_state <= IDLE; // Reset to IDLE state
    else 
        cur_state <= next_state; // Update current state to next state
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the code:

1. **State Definitions**: Each state is defined using a parameter for clarity.
   - `IDLE`: Initial state; no inputs received.
   - `SA`: State indicating that input `a` has been received.
   - `SB`: State indicating that input `b` has been received.
   - `SAB`: State indicating that both inputs have been received, either simultaneously or non-simultaneously.

2. **State Transition Logic**: 
   - The `always @(*)` block defines how the state transitions occur based on the current state and inputs. 
   - The FSM moves to `SA` when `a` is received, `SB` when `b` is received, and it transitions to `SAB` when it detects that both `a` and `b` have been received.

3. **Output Logic**: 
   - The output `z` is high (`1`) only when the FSM is in the `SAB` state.

4. **State Update Logic**: 
   - The `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block updates the current state on the rising edge of the clock or resets it if a reset signal is received.

### Notes:
- This design assumes that the inputs can change asynchronously around the clock edge; smoother operation might require debouncing or synchronisation depending on the actual signal nature youâ€™re working with.
- The FSM is synchronous and will only check the input at the clock's rising edge, making it suitable for digital design.
