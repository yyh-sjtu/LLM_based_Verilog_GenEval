Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation for a left rotate operation as described in the module signature you've provided. The module performs a left rotation of the input data by a specified amount on each rising clock edge, while also allowing for resetting and loading new data.

Hereâ€™s the implementation:

```verilog
module left_rotate(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [2:0] amount,  // Amount to shift/rotate
    input [7:0] data,    // Data to shift/rotate
    input load,          // Load signal to load new data
    output reg [7:0] out // Output after rotation
);

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            out <= 8'b0; // Clear the output on reset
        end else if (load) begin
            out <= data; // Load new data if load signal is high
        end else begin
            // Perform left rotation
            out <= (out << amount) | (out >> (8 - amount));
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input/Output Declarations**: 
   - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
   - `reset`: Asynchronous reset signal to clear the output.
   - `amount`: 3-bit input specifying how many bits to rotate left.
   - `data`: 8-bit input that can be loaded to `out`.
   - `load`: Signal to load new data into `out`.
   - `out`: 8-bit output that holds the current rotated value.

2. **Always Block**: 
   - Triggered on the rising edge of `clk` or when `reset` is asserted.
   - If `reset` is high, `out` is cleared.
   - If `load` is high, `out` is loaded with the `data` input.
   - If neither `reset` nor `load` is high, the rotation operation is executed.
   - The left rotation is performed by shifting `out` left by `amount` bits and combining it with the bits that "wrap around" from the left side using the right shift operation.

### Note:
- You may want to consider boundary conditions (rotating by 0, 8, etc.), but with the current implementation, rotating by any amount from 1 to 7 works correctly as `>>` and `<<` handle those cases properly.
- If `amount` is 0, the output will remain unchanged because of the nature of the bitwise operations. You might want to optimize the logic further if you're looking for specific edge behavior.
