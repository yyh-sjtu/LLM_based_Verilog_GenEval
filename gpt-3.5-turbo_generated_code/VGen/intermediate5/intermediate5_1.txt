Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of a left rotate operation for an 8-bit data input. The module takes an input clock (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset`), a 3-bit amount (`amount`) indicating the number of positions to rotate, an 8-bit data input (`data`), a load signal (`load`), and outputs an 8-bit result (`out`).

```verilog
module left_rotate(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [2:0] amount,
    input [7:0] data,
    input load,
    output reg [7:0] out
);

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            out <= 8'b0;  // Reset output to zero
        end else if (load) begin
            out <= data;  // Load data when load signal is high
        end else begin
            // Perform left rotate operation
            out <= (out << amount) | (out >> (8 - amount));
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reset Condition**: The output (`out`) is reset to `0` when `reset` is high.
2. **Load Condition**: If the `load` signal is high, the `data` input is assigned to the output (`out`).
3. **Left Rotate Operation**:
   - The left rotate operation is performed using bitwise operations. The expression `(out << amount)` shifts the bits of `out` to the left by `amount`.
   - The expression `(out >> (8 - amount))` shifts the bits of `out` to the right by `(8 - amount)`, effectively wrapping the left-shifted bits around to the right side.
   - The `|` operator combines the two results to achieve the rotation.

### Notes:
- This design assumes that the `amount` value will always be within the range of 0 to 7.
- The rotation happens on the rising edge of the clock, ensuring synchronization with the clock signal.
- If you want to handle edge cases (like `amount` > 7) or include additional features, you can enhance the module further based on your requirements.
