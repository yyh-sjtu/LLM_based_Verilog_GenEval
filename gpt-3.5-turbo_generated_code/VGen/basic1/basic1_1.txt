Sure! Below is the Verilog implementation of a module named `wire_assign` that assigns the output (`out`) to the input (`in`). 

```verilog
// This is a module that assigns the output to the input
module wire_assign(
    input wire in,    // Declare input
    output wire out   // Declare output
);

// Continuous assignment: out is assigned the value of in
assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is declared with the name `wire_assign`. It has two ports: `in` as an input and `out` as an output.
- **Input and Output**: The `input` and `output` ports are declared using `input wire` and `output wire`. This is usually indicated to specify that they are of type wire. In Verilog, when you define a port as an output, it is automatically treated as a wire type unless specified otherwise.
- **Continuous Assignment**: The `assign` statement creates a continuous assignment that connects `out` directly to `in`, meaning `out` will always reflect the value of `in`.

This module can be instantiated in larger designs where you would want to pass a signal through unchanged.
