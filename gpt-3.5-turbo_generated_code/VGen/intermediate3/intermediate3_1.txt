Certainly! Here's a complete implementation of a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The feedback value is calculated based on the XOR of the specified taps and is fed back into the shift register.

Here's the Verilog code for the LFSR module:

```verilog
module lfsr(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output [4:0] q
);
    reg [4:0] r_reg;                // Register to hold current state
    wire feedback_value;            // Feedback value for LFSR
    wire [4:0] r_next;             // Next state of the LFSR

    // Feedback is based on the taps at bit positions 5 and 3
    assign feedback_value = r_reg[4] ^ r_reg[2]; // Taps at 5 (r_reg[4]) and 3 (r_reg[2])
    
    // Calculate the next state
    assign r_next = {r_reg[3:0], feedback_value}; // Shift left and insert feedback

    // Update the register on clock edge or reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            r_reg <= 5'b00001; // Initial state (non-zero to avoid zero state)
        end
        else begin
            r_reg <= r_next; // Update the register to the next state
        end
    end

    // Assign the output to the current state of the register
    assign q = r_reg;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Register and Output**:
   - `r_reg`: Holds the current state of the LFSR.
   - `q`: The output which is the current state of the LFSR.

2. **Feedback Calculation**:
   - The feedback value is calculated from the bits at position 5 (`r_reg[4]`) and position 3 (`r_reg[2]`). This is done using the XOR operation: `feedback_value = r_reg[4] ^ r_reg[2]`.

3. **Next State Logic**:
   - The next state (`r_next`) is calculated by shifting the register to the left and inserting the feedback value at the least significant bit (LSB).

4. **Clock and Reset Logic**:
   - When the reset signal is high, the register `r_reg` is initialized to a non-zero state (`5'b00001`).
   - On every positive edge of the `clk` signal, the register is updated with the computed `r_next`.

5. **Output Assignment**:
   - The output `q` is continuously updated to reflect the current state of the LFSR.

### Usage:
This LFSR can be instantiated and used in larger designs for purposes such as random number generation, scramblers, or spread-spectrum communications. Make sure to properly handle the reset condition to avoid starting in the zero state.
