Certainly! Here is a simple implementation of an AND gate in Verilog:

```verilog
// This is a module that implements an AND gate
module and_gate( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out 
);
    // Internal logic for AND operation
    assign out = a & b;
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `and_gate`. It has two inputs (`a` and `b`) and one output (`out`).
2. **Logic Operation**: The `assign` statement drives the output `out` to the result of the logical AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`.
3. **Signal Types**: The inputs and output are implicitly declared as `wire` by default.

### Usage:
You can instantiate this module in a testbench or another module to verify its functionality. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how you might instantiate it in a testbench:

```verilog
module tb_and_gate;
    reg a;
    reg b;
    wire out;

    // Instantiate the AND gate
    and_gate uut (
        .a(a),
        .b(b),
        .out(out)
    );

    initial begin
        // Test all combinations of a and b
        a = 0; b = 0; #10; // out should be 0
        a = 0; b = 1; #10; // out should be 0
        a = 1; b = 0; #10; // out should be 0
        a = 1; b = 1; #10; // out should be 1

        // End simulation
        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```

This testbench will help verify the functionality of the `and_gate` by testing all possible input combinations.
