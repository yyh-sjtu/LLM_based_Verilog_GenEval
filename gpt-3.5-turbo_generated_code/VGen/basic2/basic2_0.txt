Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation for a simple AND gate module, including the necessary code to define inputs and outputs. Additionally, Iâ€™ll include a brief comment to explain the functionality.

```verilog
// This is a module that implements an AND gate
module and_gate( 
    input a,      // First input
    input b,      // Second input
    output out    // Output
);

// Implementing the AND operation
assign out = a & b; // out is high if both a and b are high

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Definition**: The module is named `and_gate`. It has two inputs (`a` and `b`) and one output (`out`).

2. **Data Types**: The inputs and output are defined as single-bit signals.

3. **AND Operation**: The `assign` statement is used to continuously drive the output `out` with the result of the AND operation (`a & b`).

### Usage:

You can instantiate this module in other parts of your Verilog code, and it will work as expected to perform the AND operation between the two inputs. If you need any additional modifications or explanations, feel free to ask!
