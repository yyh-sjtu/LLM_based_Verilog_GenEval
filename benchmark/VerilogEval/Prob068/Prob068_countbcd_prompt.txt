I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output ena (4 bits)
 - output q   (16 bits)

The module should implement a 4-digit BCD (binary-coded decimal) counter.
Each decimal digit is encoded using 4 bits: q[3:0] is the ones digit,
q[7:4] is the tens digit, etc. For digits [3:1], also output an enable
signal indicating when each of the upper three digits should be
incremented. Include a synchronous active-high reset. Assume all
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
