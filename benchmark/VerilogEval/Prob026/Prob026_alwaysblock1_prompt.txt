I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output out_assign
 - output out_alwaysblock

The module should implement an AND gate using both an assign statement
and a combinational always block.
