I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  sel
 - output out

The module should implement a one-bit wide, 2-to-1 multiplexer. When
sel=0, choose a. When sel=1, choose b.
