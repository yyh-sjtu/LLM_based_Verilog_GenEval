You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement a 64-bit Johnson counter (torsional ring counter) with verilog, and cyclic state of the the similar 4-bit Johnson counter is as follows: 0000, 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111, 0111, 0011, 0001, 0000. The datapath is shown in the picture.
Module name:  
    JC_counter               
Input ports：
    input                clk ,
    input                rst_n
Output ports：
    output reg [63:0]     Q
