Complete a 64-bit Johnson counter (torsional ring counter) with verilog, and cyclic state of the the similar 4-bit Johnson counter is as follows: 0000, 1000, 1100, 1110, 1111, 0111, 0011, 0001, 0000.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
`timescale 1ns/1ns

module verified_JC_counter(
   input                clk ,
   input                rst_n,
 
   output reg [63:0]     Q  
);
    
```
Please complete the above verilog code.
