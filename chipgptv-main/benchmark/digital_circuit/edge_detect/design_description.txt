You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement a module for edge detection with verilog, there is a slowly changing 1 bit signal a. When the rising edge of signal a is detected, the indicating signal rise is given; when the falling edge of signal A is shown, the indicating signal down is given. rise and down are high on the next clock when the corresponding edge appears, and then return to 0 until the corresponding edge appears again. The datapath is shown in the picture.

Module name:  
    edge_detect               
Input ports：
    input clk,
	input rst_n,
	input a 
Output ports：
    output reg rise,
	output reg down
