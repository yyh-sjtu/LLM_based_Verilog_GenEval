Implement a module for edge detection, there is a slowly changing 1 bit signal a. When the rising edge of signal a is detected, the indicating signal rise is given; when the falling edge of signal A is shown, the indicating signal down is given. rise and down are high on the next clock when the corresponding edge appears, and then return to 0 until the corresponding edge appears again.
Module name:  
    edge_detect               
Input ports：
    input clk,
	input rst_n,
	input a 
Output ports：
    output reg rise,
	output reg down
