Please act as a professional verilog designer.

Implement a multi-bit MUX synchronizer, data_in will remain constant during the period when data_en is high, and data_en is high for at least 3 B clock cycles. When the value of data_en is high, data can be synchronized. The data change frequency of data_in is very low. The change interval between two adjacent data is at least 10 B clock cycles.
