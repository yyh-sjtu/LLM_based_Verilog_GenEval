Give me the next token of the verilog code snippet.

Complete a multi-bit MUX synchronizer with verilog, data_in will remain constant during the period when data_en is high, and data_en is high for at least 3 B clock cycles. When the value of data_en is high, data can be synchronized. The data change frequency of data_in is very low. The change interval between two adjacent data is at least 10 B clock cycles.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_mux(
	input 				clk_a	, 
	input 				clk_b	,   
	input 				arstn	,
	input				brstn   ,
	input		[3:0]	data_in	,
	input               data_en ,

	output reg  [3:0] 	dataout
);
    reg [3:0] data_reg;
    reg       data_en_a, data_en_b0, data_en_b1;
    
    always@(posedge clk_a or negedge 
```
