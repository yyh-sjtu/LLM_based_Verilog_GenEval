You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement the design where a single clock-cycle width pulse(data_in) is extracted from the A clock(fast) domain and a new single clock-width pulse (dataout) will be created in the clock domain B(slow). The frequency of clock domain A is 10 times that of clock domain B. The datapath is shown in the picture.

Module name:  
    pulse_detect               
Input ports：
    input                 clk_fast    , 
    input                 clk_slow    ,   
    input                 rst_n        ,
    input                 data_in	
Output ports：
     output               dataout
