Please act as a professional verilog designer.

Implement the design where a single clock-cycle width pulse(data_in) is extracted from the A clock(fast) domain and a new single clock-width pulse (data_out) will be created in the clock domain B(slow). The frequency of clock domain A is 10 times that of clock domain B.
