Give me the next token of the verilog code snippet.

Complete the design where a single clock-cycle width pulse(data_in) is extracted from the A clock(fast) domain and a new single clock-width pulse (dataout) will be created in the clock domain B(slow). The frequency of clock domain A is 10 times that of clock domain B.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_pulse_detect(
	input 				clk_fast	, 
	input 				clk_slow	,   
	input 				rst_n		,
	input				
```
