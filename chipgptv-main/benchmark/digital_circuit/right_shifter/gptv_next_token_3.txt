Give me the next token of the verilog code snippet.

Complete a a right shifter with verilog. Unrestricted serial input with a delay of 8bits after passing through the register. The module performs an 8-bit right shift on a 1-bit input by first initializing the q register to 0. On each rising edge of the clock, the module shifts the contents of the q register to the right by one bit and inserts the new input bit d into the most significant position of the register. The datapath is shown in the picture.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_right_shifter(clk, q,d);  
     input  clk;  
     input d;  
     output  [7:0] q;  
      reg   [7:0]  q; 
    initial q = 0;
    always @(posedge clk)
          begin
            q<=(q>>1);
            q[7]<=d;
          end  

```
