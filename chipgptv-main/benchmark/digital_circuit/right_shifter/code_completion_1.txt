Complete a a right shifter with verilog. Unrestricted serial input with a delay of 8bits after passing through the register. The module performs an 8-bit right shift on a 1-bit input by first initializing the q register to 0. On each rising edge of the clock, the module shifts the contents of the q register to the right by one bit and inserts the new input bit d into the most significant position of the register. The datapath is shown in the picture.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_right_shifter(clk, q,d);  
     
```
Please complete the above verilog code.
