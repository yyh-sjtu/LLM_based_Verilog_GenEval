You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement a a right shifter with verilog. Unrestricted serial input with a delay of 8bits after passing through the register. The module performs an 8-bit right shift on a 1-bit input by first initializing the q register to 0. On each rising edge of the clock, the module shifts the contents of the q register to the right by one bit and inserts the new input bit d into the most significant position of the register. The datapath is shown in the picture.

Module name:  
    right_shifter               
Input ports：
    input  clk,  
    input d
Output ports：
    output  [7:0] q
