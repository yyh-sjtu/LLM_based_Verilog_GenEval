Complete a series-parallel conversion circuit, the input end inputs single bit data, and when the module receives 6 input data, the output end outputs the 6bit data after splicing. The module adopts the valid-ready two-way handshake mechanism between the input and upstream, and the valid-only handshake mechanism between the output and downstream. During data concatenation, the received data is placed in the lower part of data_b. Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog

module verified_serial2parallel(
    input               clk         ,   
    input               rst_n       ,
    input               valid_a     ,
    input               data_a      ,
 
    output  reg            
```
Please complete the above verilog code.
