Please act as a professional verilog designer.

Implement a series-parallel conversion circuit, the input end inputs single bit data, and when the module receives 6 input data, the output end outputs the 6bit data after splicing. The module adopts the valid-ready two-way handshake mechanism between the input and upstream, and the valid-only handshake mechanism between the output and downstream. During data concatenation, the received data is placed in the lower part of data_b. 
Module name:

Output ports：
    output	reg 		ready_a		,
 	output	reg			valid_b		,
	output  reg [5:0] 	data_b
