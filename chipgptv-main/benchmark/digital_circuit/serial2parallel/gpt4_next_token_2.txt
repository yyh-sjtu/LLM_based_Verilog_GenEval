Give me the next token of the verilog code snippet.

Complete a series-parallel conversion circuit, the input end inputs single bit data, and when the module receives 6 input data, the output end outputs the 6bit data after splicing. The module adopts the valid-ready two-way handshake mechanism between the input and upstream, and the valid-only handshake mechanism between the output and downstream. During data concatenation, the received data is placed in the lower part of data_b. Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog

module verified_serial2parallel(
    input               clk         ,   
    input               rst_n       ,
    input               valid_a     ,
    input               data_a      ,
 
    output  reg            ready_a     ,
    output  reg         valid_b     ,
    output      [5:0]   data_b
);

always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
        ready_a <= 1'b0;
    end
    else 
        ready_a <= 1'b1;
 end

reg [2:0]cnt;
reg [5:0]data_t,data_t1;
always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) 
```
