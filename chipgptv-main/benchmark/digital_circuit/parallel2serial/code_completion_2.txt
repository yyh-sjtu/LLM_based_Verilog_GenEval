Complete a module for parallel-to-serial conversion with verilog, where every four input bits are converted to one output bit. The output signal valid_in indicates the validity of the input at that time. The datapath is shown in the picture.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
`timescale 
```
Please complete the above verilog code.
