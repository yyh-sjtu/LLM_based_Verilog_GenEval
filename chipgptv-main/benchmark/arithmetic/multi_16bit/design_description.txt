You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement the design of unsigned 16bit multiplier based on shifting and adding opration with verilog. The datapath is shown in the picture. 
Module name:  
    multi_16bit               
Input ports：
    input clk;       
    input rst_n;      
    input start;      // Chip enable signal. 
    input [15:0] ain; 
    input [15:0] bin;
Output ports：
    output [31:0] yout; // Product output with a data width of 32 bits.
    output done;      // Chip output flag signal. Defined as 1 indicates multiplication operation completion.
