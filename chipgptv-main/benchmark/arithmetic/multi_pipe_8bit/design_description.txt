You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement the design of unsigned 8bit multiplier based on pipelining processing with verilog. The datapath is shown in the picture. 
Module name:  
    multi_pipe_8bit               
Input ports：
    input clk;           
    input rst_n; 
    input mul_en_in;      
    input [size-1:0] mul_a;       
    input [size-1:0] mul_b;  	
Output ports：
    output reg mul_en_out;  
    output reg [size*2-1:0] mul_out;
