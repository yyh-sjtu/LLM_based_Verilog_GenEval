You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement a 16-bit carry select adder with verilog using the following modules. The datapath is shown in the picture.

module carry_select_adder_16bit(a, b, cin, sum, cout);
input [15:0] a,b;
input cin;
output [15:0] sum;
output cout;
