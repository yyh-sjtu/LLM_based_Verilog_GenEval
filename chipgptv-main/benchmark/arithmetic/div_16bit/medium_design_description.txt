Implement a 16-bit divider module with verilog, dividend is 16-bit and divider is 16-bit. Extract the higher bits of the dividend, matching the bit width of the divisor. Compare these bits with the divisor: if the dividend bits are greater, set the quotient to 1, otherwise set it to 0, and use the difference as the remainder. Concatenate the remainder with the highest remaining 1-bit of the dividend, and repeat the process until all dividend bits are processed. The datapath is shown in the picture.
Module name:
div_16bit
Input ports：
input wire [15:0] A,
input wire [7:0] B,
Output ports：
output wire [15:0] result,
output wire [15:0] odd
