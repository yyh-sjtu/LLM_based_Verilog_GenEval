Complete a 16-bit divider module with verilog, dividend is 16-bit and divider is 16-bit. Extract the higher bits of the dividend, matching the bit width of the divisor. Compare these bits with the divisor: if the dividend bits are greater, set the quotient to 1, otherwise set it to 0, and use the difference as the remainder. Concatenate the remainder with the highest remaining 1-bit of the dividend, and repeat the process until all dividend bits are processed. The datapath is shown in the picture.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] 
```
Please complete the above verilog code.
