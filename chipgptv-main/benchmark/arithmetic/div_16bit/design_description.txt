You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement a 16-bit divider module with verilog, dividend is 16-bit and divider is 16-bit. Extract the higher bits of the dividend, matching the bit width of the divisor. Compare these bits with the divisor: if the dividend bits are greater, set the quotient to 1, otherwise set it to 0, and use the difference as the remainder. Concatenate the remainder with the highest remaining 1-bit of the dividend, and repeat the process until all dividend bits are processed. The datapath is shown in the picture.
Module name:
div_16bit
Input ports：
input wire [15:0] A,
input wire [7:0] B,
Output ports：
output wire [15:0] result,
output wire [15:0] odd
