Give me the next token of the verilog code snippet.

Complete a 16-bit divider module with verilog, dividend is 16-bit and divider is 16-bit. Extract the higher bits of the dividend, matching the bit width of the divisor. Compare these bits with the divisor: if the dividend bits are greater, set the quotient to 1, otherwise set it to 0, and use the difference as the remainder. Concatenate the remainder with the highest remaining 1-bit of the dividend, and repeat the process until all dividend bits are processed.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_div_16bit(
    input wire [15:0] A,
    input wire [15:0] B,
    output wire [15:0] result,
    output wire [15:0] odd
    );

reg [15:0] 
```
