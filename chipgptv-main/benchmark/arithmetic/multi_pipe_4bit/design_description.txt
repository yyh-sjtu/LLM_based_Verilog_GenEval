You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement the design of 4bit unsigned number pipeline multiplier with verilog. The datapath is shown in the picture. 
Module name:  
    multi_pipe               
Input ports：
    input 						clk 		,   
	input 						rst_n		,
	input	[size-1:0]			mul_a		,
	input	[size-1:0]			mul_b		
Output ports：
    output	reg	[size*2-1:0]	mul_out
