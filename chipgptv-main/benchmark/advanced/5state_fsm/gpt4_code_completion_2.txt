Complete a FSM detection circuit that detects a single bit input IN with verilog.When the number of 1s in the input is modulo 5, the result is 4, output MATCH is high, and MATCH is 0 in other cases.The state transfer diagram is shown in the picture.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_fsm5 (
    input IN, CLK, RST,
    output reg MATCH
);

    reg [2:0] ST_cr, ST_nt;

    parameter s0 = 3'b000, s1 = 3'b001, s2 = 3'b010, s3 = 3'b011, s4 = 3'b100;

    always @(posedge CLK or posedge RST) begin
        if (RST)
            ST_cr = s0;
        else
            
```
Please complete the above verilog code.
