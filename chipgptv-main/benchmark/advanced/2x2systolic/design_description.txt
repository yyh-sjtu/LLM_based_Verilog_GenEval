You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

This is an 2x2 systolic array with weight station. Every processing unit(PE) has two input and two output. The function of every PE is to multiply two input and add the value from inner register. The systolic array receives weight from weight buffer and input from input, then output to outputt. The datapath is shown in the picture.


module systolic2x2(
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input [15:0] weight [0:1] [0:1], // weight station
  input [15:0] inputt [0:1] [0:1],        // input buffer
  output [31:0] outputt [0:1] [0:1]      // output buffer 
);
