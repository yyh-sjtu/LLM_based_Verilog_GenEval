You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

The state machine has two states. One of the state is S0, the other is S1. The output of S0 is 9, the output of S1 is 8. The state machine would change its state when a is 1 and b is 0. The datapath is shown in the picture.

// State machine design
module state_machine(
  input a,
  input b,
  input clk,
  input rst,
  output reg [3:0] state
);
