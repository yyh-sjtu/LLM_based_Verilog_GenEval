Give me the next token of the verilog code snippet.

This three stages is a hardware pipeline that fetches instruct and execute. The instruction is add and sub. Executor fetch two operand and write back to memory.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
// Instruction types
`define ADD_INST 2'b00
`define SUB_INST 2'b01
// Pipeline stages 
module fetch_stage(
  input clk,
  output 
```
