Complete this verilog code.

Every processing unit(PE) has two input and two output. The function of every PE is to multiply two input and add the value from inner register. The final result of evert PE is c. At the next cycle, the b0 will pass from left PE to right PE as b1. There are four PE.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module systolic1x4(
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input [15:0] a0,
  input 
```
Please complete the above verilog code.
