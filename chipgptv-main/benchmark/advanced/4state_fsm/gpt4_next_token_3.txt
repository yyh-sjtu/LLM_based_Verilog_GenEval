Give me the next token of the verilog code snippet.

Complete a FSM detection circuit that detects a single bit input IN with verilog.Let the number of 1's in input be x, and the number of 0's in input be y. When x-y>0 and (x-y) modulo 4 is 3,output MATCH is high; when y-x>0 and (y-x) modulo 4 is 1,  output MATCH is high, and MATCH is 0 in other cases.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_fsm4 (
    input IN, CLK, RST,
    output reg 
```
