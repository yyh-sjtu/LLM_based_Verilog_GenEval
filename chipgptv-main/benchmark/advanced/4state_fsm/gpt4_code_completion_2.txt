Complete a FSM detection circuit that detects a single bit input IN with verilog.Let the number of 1's in input be x, and the number of 0's in input be y. When x-y>0 and (x-y) modulo 4 is 3,output MATCH is high; when y-x>0 and (y-x) modulo 4 is 1,  output MATCH is high, and MATCH is 0 in other cases.The state transfer diagram is shown in the picture.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
module verified_fsm4 (
    input IN, CLK, RST,
    output 
```
Please complete the above verilog code.
