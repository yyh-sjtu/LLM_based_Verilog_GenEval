Give me the next token of the verilog code snippet.

Complete a FSM detection circuit that detects a single bit input IN with verilog. When the input is 10011, output MATCH is high, and MATCH is 0 in other cases.The state transfer diagram is shown in the picture. You should first give me the understanding of the state diagram in the picture, and then output the verilog code of the design.Here's the imcomplete verilog code: 
 ```verilog
