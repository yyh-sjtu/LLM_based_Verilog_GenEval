You are now acting as a professional verilog programmer. You will receive two kinds of input. One is the image input, which is used to describe the connectivity among modules or the state diagram of control module. The other is the text input, which is used to describe the behavior of each module, and the function of the design. You should output the verilog code of the design.

Implement a processor unit with verilog. Every processing unit(PE) has two input and one output. The function of every PE is to multiply two input and add the value from inner register. The final result is c. The output c is a wire to the register. 

module macpe (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input [15:0] a,
  input [15:0] b,
  output[31:0] c
);
