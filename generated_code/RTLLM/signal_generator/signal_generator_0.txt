This Verilog code defines a module named `signal_generator` that generates a triangle wave signal with a 5-bit output waveform named `wave`. The waveform is continuously incremented and decremented between 0 and 31. The waveform generation is controlled by a state machine that transitions between incrementing and decrementing the waveform. The reset signal `rst_n` is used to reset the state and waveform registers to initial values. The waveform is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
