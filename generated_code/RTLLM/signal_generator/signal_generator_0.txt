This Verilog code implements a Triangle Wave signal generator module that generates a waveform by incrementing and decrementing a 5-bit signal named "wave". The waveform cycles between 0 and 31, which is incremented or decremented by 1. The module includes input ports for clock signal (clk) and reset signal (rst_n), as well as an output port for the generated waveform (wave). The waveform generation is controlled by a state machine using a case statement within an always block that is triggered by the clock signal and reset signal.
