Here is the complete Verilog code for the 16-bit divider module:

```verilog
module div_16bit (
    input [15:0] A,
    input [7:0] B,
    output reg [15:0] result,
    output reg [15:0] odd
);

reg [15:0] a_reg;
reg [7:0] b_reg;

always @ (*) begin
    a_reg = A;
    b_reg = B;
end

always @ (*) begin
    reg [15:0] quotient;
    reg [15:0] remainder;

    quotient = 16'b0;
    remainder = 16'b0;
    
    for (int i = 15; i >= 0; i = i - 1) begin
        remainder = {remainder[14:0], a_reg[15]};
        if (remainder >= b_reg) begin
            quotient[i] = 1;
            remainder = remainder - b_reg;
        end
        a_reg = {a_reg[14:0], A[15]};
    end
    
    result = quotient;
    odd = remainder;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, we define the module `div_16bit` with input ports `A` and `B` for the dividend and divisor, and output ports `result` for the quotient and `odd` for the remainder. The two always blocks are used to update the registers with the input values and perform the division operation. The division operation is done using a for loop to iterate through each bit of the dividend, comparing it with the divisor and updating the quotient and remainder accordingly.
