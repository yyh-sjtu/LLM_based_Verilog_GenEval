Here is the Verilog code for the adder_32bit module implementing a carry-lookahead 32-bit adder using the CLA architecture:

```verilog
module cla_16bit (
    input [15:0] A,
    input [15:0] B,
    output [15:0] S,
    output C
);

assign G = A & B;
assign P = A ^ B;
assign Gp = G + P;

assign S = Gp ^ P;
assign C = G | (P & C);

endmodule

module adder_32bit (
    input [31:0] A,
    input [31:0] B,
    output [31:0] S,
    output C32
);

wire [15:0] c_in;
wire [15:0] c_out;

cla_16bit cla0 (.A(A[15:0]), .B(B[15:0]), .S(S[15:0]), .C(c_in[0]));
cla_16bit cla1 (.A(A[31:16]), .B(B[31:16]), .S(S[31:16]), .C(c_in[1]));

cla_16bit cla2 (.A(S[15:0]), .B(c_in), .S(S[15:0]), .C(c_out[0]));
cla_16bit cla3 (.A(S[31:16]), .B(c_out), .S(S[31:16]), .C(C32));

endmodule
```

In this code, we first define the 16-bit CLA module cla_16bit, which takes two 16-bit inputs A and B, and outputs the sum S and carry C. The carry-lookahead logic is implemented within this module.

Next, we define the adder_32bit module, which instantiates four instances of the cla_16bit module to create a 32-bit adder. The carry output of each 16-bit CLA block is connected to the carry input of the next block, allowing for efficient propagation of the carry signal. The final carry-out C32 is the carry output of the last 16-bit CLA block.

This code provides a systematic and efficient implementation of a 32-bit carry-lookahead adder using the CLA architecture.
