Sure, here is the verilog code for the decade counter module as per your requirements:

```verilog
module decade_counter(
    input clk,
    input slowena,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

reg [3:0] next_q;

always @(posedge clk, posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else if (slowena) begin
        next_q = q + 1;
        if (next_q == 4'b1010) begin
            next_q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            q <= next_q;
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This verilog module is a decade counter that starts counting from 0 to 9 (represented as 4'b0000 to 4'b1001) whenever the `slowena` input is high. The counter resets to 0 when the `reset` input is high. The counter increments on each positive edge of the `clk` input signal.
