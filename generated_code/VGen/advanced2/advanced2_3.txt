Sure, here is the verilog code for the decade counter module as described:

```verilog
module decade_counter (
    input clk,
    input slowena,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        if (slowena) begin
            if (q == 4'b1001) begin
                q <= 4'b0000;
            end else begin
                q <= q + 4'b0001;
            end
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This verilog module describes a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9, inclusive. The counter increments by 1 each time the `slowena` signal is high. The counter is reset to 0 when the `reset` signal is high. The counter operates on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk` and the current count value is stored in the 4-bit register `q`.
