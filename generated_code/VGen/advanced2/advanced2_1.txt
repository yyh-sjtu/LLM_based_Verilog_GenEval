This Verilog module is a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9 inclusive. The counter only increments when the `slowena` input is high. The reset input can be used to reset the counter to 0. The current count value is stored in the `count` register, which is then assigned to the output `q`. The counter increments on the positive edge of the clock signal.
