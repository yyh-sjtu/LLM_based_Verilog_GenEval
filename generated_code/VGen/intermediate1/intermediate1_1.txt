Sure, here is the implementation of the half adder module in Verilog:

```verilog
module half_adder(
  input a, b,
  output cout, sum
);

  // Output signals
  assign sum = a ^ b; // XOR gate implementation for sum
  assign cout = a & b; // AND gate implementation for carry out

endmodule
```

This Verilog module takes two input signals `a` and `b`, and outputs the sum `sum` and carry out `cout` of a half adder circuit. The `sum` is calculated using an XOR gate and the `cout` is calculated using an AND gate. This implementation can be used in larger designs involving addition of binary numbers.
