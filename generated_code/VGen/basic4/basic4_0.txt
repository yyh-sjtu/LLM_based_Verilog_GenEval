Here is the Verilog implementation of the 2-to-1 multiplexer module:

```verilog
module mux(
    input [4:0] a, b,
    input sel,
    output reg [4:0] out
);

always @(a, b, sel)
begin
    if(sel == 1'b0)
        out = a;
    else
        out = b;
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the module has two 5-bit input ports a and b, a single-bit select signal sel, and a 5-bit output port out. The output port will be connected to the input port a if sel is 0, and will be connected to the input port b if sel is 1. The `always` block continuously monitors the inputs a, b, and sel and updates the output out accordingly.
