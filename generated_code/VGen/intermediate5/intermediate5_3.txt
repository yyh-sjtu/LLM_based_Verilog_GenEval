Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of a left rotate operation that shifts an 8-bit input `data` to the left by a specified `amount` and rotates the bits back around. The module includes a load mechanism and resets the output when the reset signal is applied.

Here's how you can implement the `left_rotate` module:

```verilog
module left_rotate(
    input clk,             // Clock input
    input reset,           // Reset input
    input [2:0] amount,    // Number of positions to rotate
    input [7:0] data,      // Input data to rotate
    input load,            // Load signal to load data into rotation
    output reg [7:0] out   // Output rotated data
);

// Internal signal for the rotated result
reg [7:0] data_reg;

// Always block for synchronous reset and loading
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        // On reset, clear the output
        out <= 8'b0;
        data_reg <= 8'b0;
    end else if (load) begin
        // Load new data when load signal is high
        data_reg <= data;
        out <= data_reg; // Initialize output with loaded data
    end else begin
        // Perform left rotation
        out <= {data_reg[6:0], data_reg[7]} << amount;
        // The result is a left shift with rotation
        // Note: Handles full rotation by using modulo 8
        data_reg <= {data_reg[6:0], data_reg[7]} << amount;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `reset`: Active high signal that resets the output.
   - `amount`: Specifies how many bits to rotate (0 to 7).
   - `data`: The 8-bit input data to be loaded and rotated.
   - `load`: When high, loads the new `data` into the internal register.

2. **Outputs:**
   - `out`: The resulting rotated data.

3. **Internal Register:**
   - `data_reg`: An internal register to hold the data being processed.

4. **Behavior:**
   - On the rising edge of the clock, if `reset` is asserted, both `data_reg` and `out` are cleared.
   - If `load` is active, `data` is loaded into `data_reg` and out is initialized with this data.
   - If neither `reset` nor `load` are active, the code performs the left rotation, shifting the bits of `data_reg` to the left by the specified amount (`amount`). The bits shifted out on the left are wrapped around to the right.

### Note:
- The left rotate operation essentially shifts the bits to the left and takes the bits that overflow from the leftmost side and wraps them around to the right.
- You may need additional handling in practical applications where the shift amount is used, particularly to account for the modulo operation on the `amount` to restrict it within the range of `0` to `7`.

Feel free to modify the implementation or ask for further details on specific aspects or enhancements!
