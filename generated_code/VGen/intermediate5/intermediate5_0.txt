Here is the implementation of the module for the shift left and rotate operation in Verilog:

```verilog
module left_rotate(
  input clk,
  input reset,
  input [2:0] amount,
  input [7:0] data,
  input load,
  output reg [7:0] out
);

  reg [7:0] temp;
  
  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if(reset) begin
      out <= 8'b0;
      temp <= 8'b0;
    end else begin
      if(load) begin
        temp <= data;
        out <= temp;
      end else begin
        temp <= {temp[6:0], temp[7]};
        out <= temp;
      end
    end
  end
endmodule
```

This module performs a shift left and rotate operation on the input data with the specified amount. The data is shifted to the left by the specified amount and the bits that are shifted out are rotated and shifted back in. The output is stored in the `out` register. The `load` input is used to load the initial data into the module. The operation is synchronous to the `clk` signal and the output `out` is updated only on the rising edge of the clock signal.
