First, we need to define the feedback logic for the LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The feedback value can be calculated by XORing certain bits of the current state.

```verilog
assign feedback_value = r_reg[4] ^ r_reg[2] ^ r_reg[1]; 
```

Next, we need to implement the logic to update the LFSR state on each clock cycle.

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        r_reg <= 5'b1; // Initial state
    end else begin
        r_reg <= r_next;
    end
end
```

Now, we need to calculate the next state based on the current state and feedback value.

```verilog
assign r_next[4:1] = r_reg[3:0]; // Shift right
assign r_next[0] = feedback_value; // XOR feedback value
```

Finally, we need to assign the output as the current state of the LFSR.

```verilog
assign q = r_reg;
```

With these implementations, the Verilog module for a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3 is complete.
