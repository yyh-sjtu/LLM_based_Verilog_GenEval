As a professional Verilog designer, I would implement the given RAM module as follows:

```verilog
module ram #(
  parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 6,
  parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8
) (
  input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data,
  input [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] addr,
  input we,
  input clk,
  output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] q
);

  reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] ram[2**ADDR_WIDTH-1:0];

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (we) begin
      ram[addr] <= data;
    end
    q <= ram[addr];
  end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, I have added a clocking mechanism to the RAM module so that it only updates the RAM array when there is a positive edge on the clock signal. The data is written to the RAM array when the write enable (we) signal is high. The output (q) is driven by the data stored at the address specified by the input address (addr).
