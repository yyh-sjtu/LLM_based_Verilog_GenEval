As a professional Verilog designer, I would implement the RAM module as follows:

```verilog
module ram #(
    parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 6,
    parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8
)
(
    input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data,
    input [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] addr,
    input we,
    input clk,
    output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] q
);

reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] ram[0:2**ADDR_WIDTH-1];

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if(we) begin
        ram[addr] <= data;
    end
    q <= ram[addr];
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the RAM module has a parameterized address width (ADDR_WIDTH) and data width (DATA_WIDTH). It takes input data and address along with write enable (we) and clock (clk) signals. The output is the data read from the RAM at the specified address.

The RAM is implemented using an array of registers where each address location stores DATA_WIDTH bits of data. The read and write operations are performed on the RAM array based on the clock signal and write enable signal.

This design allows for a flexible and parameterized RAM module that can be customized based on the required address and data widths.
