This Verilog module implements a permutation block called P_box. It takes a 32-bit input signal In32 and outputs a permuted 32-bit signal Out32 based on the predefined In32table. The In32table maps the index of each bit in the output signal to the corresponding index in the input signal. The output signal is generated by rearranging the bits of the input signal according to the indices specified in the In32table.
