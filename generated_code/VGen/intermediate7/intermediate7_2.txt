// Define the permutation logic
always @* begin
    for(i=0; i<32; i=i+1) begin
        Out32[i] = In32[In32table[i]];
    end
end

endmodule

This Verilog module defines a permutation block called P_box. It takes a 32-bit input signal In32 and outputs a permuted 32-bit signal Out32 based on the values stored in the In32table. The initial block initializes the values in the In32table according to the permutation order. The main logic block uses a for loop to assign the input values to the output signal based on the permutation order specified in the In32table.

I hope this helps in implementing the desired module. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
