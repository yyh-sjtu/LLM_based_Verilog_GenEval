This module takes in a 32-bit input signal In32 and maps it to a 32-bit output signal Out32 based on the permutation defined in the In32table. The input bits are rearranged according to the mapping in the table and assigned to the output bits. This module can be used in encryption or signal processing applications where bit permutations are required.
