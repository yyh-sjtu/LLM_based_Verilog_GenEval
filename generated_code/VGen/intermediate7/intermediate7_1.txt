This Verilog module implements a 16-bit full adder using combinational logic. The module takes 16-bit inputs A and B, along with a carry-in signal Cin. It outputs the sum of A, B, and Cin in the Sum output and the carry-out signal Cout.

The for loop inside the generate block creates individual full adder cells for each bit of the inputs. The XOR gates calculate the sum of the corresponding bits of A, B, and Cin. The carry-out signal is generated using bitwise AND and OR operations.

This module can be instantiated in a larger design to perform addition operations on 16-bit numbers.
