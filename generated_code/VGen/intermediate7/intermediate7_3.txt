This module defines a permutation block that takes a 32-bit input vector In32 and outputs a permuted 32-bit output vector Out32 based on the values stored in the In32table array. The values in the In32table array determine the order in which the bits of the input vector are arranged in the output vector. The permutation logic iterates through each entry in the In32table array and assigns the corresponding bit from the input vector to the output vector at the specified index.
