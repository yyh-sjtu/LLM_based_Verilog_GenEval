Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the specified module based on the truth table provided:

```verilog
module truthtable(input x3, input x2, input x1, output f);
    // Declare the output wire
    wire f;

    // Generate the output f based on the truth table using logical expressions
    assign f = (~x3 & ~x2) |  // f = 1 when x3=0 and x2=0 (x1 can be 0 or 1)
               (~x3 & x1) |   // f = 1 when x3=0 and x2=1 and x1=1
               (x3 & ~x2 & x1) | // f = 1 when x3=1 and x2=1 and x1=0
               (x3 & x2 & ~x1);  // f = 1 when x3=1 and x2=0

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Definitions**: The module has three inputs (`x3`, `x2`, `x1`), which are treated as 1-bit binary inputs.
- **Output Definition**: The output (`f`) is determined based on the given truth table.
- **Logical Expression**: The assign statement combines conditions derived directly from the truth table, ensuring `f` matches the specified outputs for the given inputs.

### Simplified Logic:
The logical expression is constructed based on the specified conditions:
- When `(x3, x2, x1)` is `(0, 0, 0)` or `(0, 0, 1)`, `f` should be `1`.
- When `(0, 1, 1)`, `f` should be `1`.
- When `(1, 1, 0)`, `f` should be `1`.

This ensures that the function `f` operates as required per your truth table. If you need additional information, documentation, or further changes, feel free to ask!
