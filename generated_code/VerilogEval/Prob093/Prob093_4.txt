Sure! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that generates the appropriate outputs based on the given Karnaugh map, utilizing one 4-to-1 multiplexer and necessary 2-to-1 multiplexers.

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire c,        // Input bit c
    input wire d,        // Input bit d
    output wire [3:0] mux_in // 4-bit output for the 4-to-1 multiplexer
);
    wire a, b;          // Assuming a and b are defined somewhere as inputs
    wire w0, w1, w2, w3; // Intermediate wires for the 2-to-1 multiplexers

    // 2-to-1 Mux to produce mux_in[0]
    assign w0 = (c & ~d); // c when d = 0, gives 1 for ab = 01
    assign mux_in[0] = (a == 1'b0) ? 0 : w0;

    // 2-to-1 Mux to produce mux_in[1]
    assign w1 = (c & ~d) | (~c & ~d); // 1 when c & ~d or when c is 0
    assign mux_in[1] = (a == 1'b0) ? w1 : (0); // 0 when a is 1

    // 2-to-1 Mux to produce mux_in[2]
    assign w2 = (c & d); // Only when c and d are both 1
    assign mux_in[2] = (a == 1'b0) ? w2 : (1); // 1 when a is 1 and d is 0

    // 2-to-1 Mux to produce mux_in[3]
    assign w3 = (c & ~d) | (c & d); // c will be 1 for ab=10
    assign mux_in[3] = (a == 1'b0) ? w3 : (1); // 1 when a is 1

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **Module Definition**: The module `TopModule` has two input wires `c` and `d`, and an output `mux_in` which is 4 bits wide. 

2. **Intermediate Wires**: We declare intermediate wires (w0, w1, w2, w3) that hold outputs from the multiplexers.

3. **2-to-1 Multiplexers**:
   - For each of the mux_in outputs, we use the logic from the K-map to define how the output is generated based on c and d.
   - **mux_in[0]**: Set to 1 when `a=0` and `d=0`. This is determined based on the values from K-map.
   - **mux_in[1]**: Is used to separate conditions based on values of c and d.
   - **mux_in[2]**: This handles conditions when `c` and `d` are both 1.
   - **mux_in[3]**: Similar logic applies here encoding values based on the K-map.

4. **MUX Control Logic**: Each output checks values of `a` and logic condition for `c` and `d` to produce binary outputs accumulated from the K-map.

### Note
Given the constraints of using only 2-to-1 MUX implementations, the provided Verilog code lists a basic skeletal structure that showcases how to channel inputs through selected paths of multiplexers based on conditions specified in the K-map. Make sure you adapt the actual logic based on specific placement and expected switching logic from K-map referencing, especially how `a` and `b` will actually break conditions on the `4-to-1` multiplexer you intend to use as the underlying wavefront of the outputs.
