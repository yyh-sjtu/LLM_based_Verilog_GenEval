Sure! Below is a simple Verilog implementation for the `TopModule` which drives the output `out` to logic low (0). 

```verilog
module TopModule (
    output out
);

    // Drive the output to logic low.
    assign out = 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The `module TopModule` declaration specifies the name of the module and its interface.
- The `output out` specifies that `out` is a single-bit output.
- The `assign out = 1'b0;` statement continuously assigns a logic low value (0) to the output `out`, ensuring that it always drives low.

This is a very straightforward implementation, and meets the requirement of always driving the output to logic low. If you need further modifications or additional functionality to the module, feel free to ask!
