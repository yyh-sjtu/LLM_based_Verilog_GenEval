Sure, here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing the specified interface:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    output reg out
);

always @* begin
    out = 1'b0; // always drive logic low
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with a single output port named out. The output port is always driven to logic low. Let me know if you have any questions or need any further clarification.
