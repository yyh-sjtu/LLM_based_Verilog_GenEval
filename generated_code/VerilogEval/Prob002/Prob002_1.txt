Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a Verilog module named `TopModule` that meets your specifications. The module has a single output port `out`, which always drives a logic low value (0).

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    output out  // Output port
);

// Continuously assign logic low (0) to the output
assign out = 1'b0; // 1'b0 represents a 1-bit binary value of 0

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The `module` keyword is used to declare the module named `TopModule`. The output port `out` is defined.
- **Output Assignment**: The `assign` statement is used to continually drive the `out` port to a logic low value with `1'b0`, where `1'b` denotes a 1-bit binary representation.
- **End Module**: The `endmodule` keyword signifies the end of the module definition.

### Simulation Note:

When you simulate this module, the `out` signal will always read as `0`. There are no inputs to the module since you only requested a single output that is always low.

Feel free to ask if you have any more requirements or additional functionality you'd like to implement!
