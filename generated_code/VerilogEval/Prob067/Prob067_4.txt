As a professional RTL designer, I will implement the TopModule as per your requirements. Here is the Verilog code for the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input slowena,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        if (slowena) begin
            if (q == 4'b1001) begin
                q <= 4'b0000;
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1;
            end
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9 based on the slowena input, incrementing by one on each clock cycle when slowena is high. The counter is reset to 0 when the reset input is high. The sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Please let me know if you need any further modifications or have any specific requirements.
