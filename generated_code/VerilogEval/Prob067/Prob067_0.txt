As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule with the given interface specifications as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input slowena,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

// Internal signals
reg [3:0] count;

// Synchronous reset
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        count <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        if (slowena) begin
            if (count == 4'b1001) begin
                count <= 4'b0000;
            end else begin
                count <= count + 1;
            end
        end
    end
end

// Output assignment
always @(*) begin
    q = count;
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9 with a period of 10. The counter resets to 0 on a high synchronous reset. The "slowena" signal controls the incrementing of the counter, allowing it to pause. The counter increments on each positive edge of the clock when "slowena" is high. The output q provides the 4-bit count value.
