As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule in Verilog as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input slowena,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else if (slowena) begin
        if (q == 4'b1001) begin
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the decade counter starts at 0 and increments by 1 every time the "slowena" input is high. When the counter reaches 9, it rolls back to 0. The counter is reset to 0 when the "reset" input is high. The sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
