Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule`, which serves as a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9. It incorporates the specified interface with a synchronous reset and handles the `slowena` signal to control when the counter increments.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,       // Clock input
    input  wire reset,     // Synchronous reset input
    input  wire slowena,   // Enable signal for slow counting
    output reg  [3:0] q    // 4-bit output for the counter
);

// Synchronous reset and counting logic
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        // Reset the counter to 0 if reset is high
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else if (slowena) begin
        // Increment the counter on each clock cycle if slowena is high
        if (q == 4'b1001) begin
            q <= 4'b0000; // Reset to 0 after reaching 9
        end else begin
            q <= q + 1'b1; // Increment the counter
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - The `module TopModule` declaration starts with the specified ports. `clk`, `reset`, and `slowena` are defined as input wires, while `q` is defined as a 4-bit output register.

2. **Always Block**:
   - The `always @(posedge clk)` block triggers on the rising edge of the clock signal.

3. **Reset Logic**:
   - The first condition checks for the `reset` signal. If it's high, the counter `q` is set to `0`. This ensures the reset is synchronous.

4. **Counting Logic**:
   - The next condition evaluates whether `slowena` is high. If `slowena` is high, the counter increments on each clock cycle.
   - If the current value of `q` reaches `4'b1001` (which is decimal 9), it resets back to `0` on the next increment. Otherwise, it simply increments `q` by `1`.

This implementation ensures that the module behaves correctly according to the specifications you've provided, counting from 0 to 9 and resetting as needed.
