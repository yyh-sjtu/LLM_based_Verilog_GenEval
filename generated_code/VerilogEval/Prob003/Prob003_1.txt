In Verilog, the TopModule module implementing the described interface would look like this:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    output reg one
);

    always @* begin
        one = 1'b1;
    end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with an output port named one. The always block continuously assigns a value of 1 to the output port, making sure it always drives logic high.
