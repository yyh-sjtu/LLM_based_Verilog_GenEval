Sure, I can help you with that. Here is an example implementation of the TopModule module in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    output reg one
    );

always @(posedge clk) begin
    one <= 1'b1;
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the module TopModule has one output port named "one" which is always driven with logic high (1) using an always block sensitive to the positive edge of a clock signal. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
