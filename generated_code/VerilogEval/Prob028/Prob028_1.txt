Certainly! Below is an implementation of a D latch in Verilog named `TopModule`. The latch takes an input `d`, an enable signal `ena`, and produces an output `q`. The latch holds the value of `d` when `ena` is high, and retains its state when `ena` is low.

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire d,     // Data input
    input  wire ena,   // Enable signal
    output reg  q      // Output
);

    // D latch implementation
    always @* begin
        if (ena) begin
            q = d;     // When enabled, output follows input
        end
        // If 'ena' is low, the output 'q' retains its previous value
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration:** The module `TopModule` is declared with the specified input and output ports.
   
2. **Sensitivity List:** The `always @*` sensitivity list means that the block will be re-evaluated anytime any of the inputs change. 

3. **D Latch Logic:** Inside the always block:
   - If `ena` is high (`1`), the output `q` gets updated to the value of `d`. 
   - If `ena` is low (`0`), `q` retains its last value (due to the absence of a statement in the else part, which signifies that it will keep whatever it previously held).

### Important Considerations:

- This code is synthesizable and effectively captures the behavior of a D latch.
- Ensure that you are simulating and testing this module properly with appropriate test benches to validate its functionality.
