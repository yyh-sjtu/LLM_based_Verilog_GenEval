As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule with the following Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input enable,
    input S,
    input A,
    input B,
    input C,
    output reg Z
);

reg [7:0] Q;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (enable) begin
        Q <= {Q[6:0], S};
    end
end

always @* begin
    case({A, B, C})
        3'b000: Z = Q[0];
        3'b001: Z = Q[1];
        3'b010: Z = Q[2];
        3'b011: Z = Q[3];
        3'b100: Z = Q[4];
        3'b101: Z = Q[5];
        3'b110: Z = Q[6];
        3'b111: Z = Q[7];
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

In this code, I have implemented an 8-bit shift register using D-type flip-flops to store the input bits. The enable signal controls the shifting operation on the positive edge of the clock. The output Z is determined based on the values of inputs A, B, and C, which select the corresponding bit from the shift register. This circuit behaves as an 8x1 memory with random access reading capability.
