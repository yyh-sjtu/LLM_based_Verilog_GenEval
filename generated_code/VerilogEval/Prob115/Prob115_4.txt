Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as described. This module uses a 64-bit register that can perform both left and right arithmetic shifts, with a synchronous load feature.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire        clk,
    input  wire        load,
    input  wire        ena,
    input  wire [1:0] amount,
    input  wire [63:0] data,
    output reg  [63:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the data into the shift register
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            // Shift operations based on amount
            case (amount)
                2'b00: q <= {q[62:0], 1'b0};         // Shift left by 1 bit
                2'b01: q <= {q[55:0], 8'b0};         // Shift left by 8 bits
                2'b10: q <= {q[63], q[63:1]};        // Shift right by 1 bit (arithmetic)
                2'b11: q <= {q[63], q[63:8]};        // Shift right by 8 bits (arithmetic)
                default: q <= q;                     // No operation
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Definition**: The top-level module is defined with all the required inputs and outputs.
- **Synchronous Logic**: The `always` block is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`).
- **Loading Data**: If the `load` signal is high, the module loads the provided `data` into the output `q`.
- **Shifting Logic**: If the `load` signal is low but `ena` is high, it executes a shift operation based on the value of `amount`.
  - `2'b00`: Perform a logical shift left by 1 bit.
  - `2'b01`: Perform a logical shift left by 8 bits.
  - `2'b10`: Perform an arithmetic shift right by 1 bit, preserving the sign.
  - `2'b11`: Perform an arithmetic shift right by 8 bits, preserving the sign.
- **Default Case**: If an unexpected value is received for `amount`, it retains the current value of `q`.

### Notes:
- This module assumes the standard behavior of registers and shifting in Verilog.
- Remember to synthesize and simulate this code in a suitable Verilog simulator to verify functionality and ensure it meets your design requirements.
