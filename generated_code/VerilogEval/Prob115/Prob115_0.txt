As a professional RTL designer, I would start by defining the module TopModule with the specified input and output ports as described. I would then proceed to implement the 64-bit arithmetic shift register logic inside the module.

Here is a high-level overview of how the module implementation could look:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input ena,
    input [1:0] amount,
    input [63:0] data,
    output reg [63:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data;
    end else if (ena) begin
        case (amount)
            2'b00: q <= {q[62:0], q[63]};
            2'b01: q <= {q[55:0], data[63:56]};
            2'b10: q <= {q[0], q[63:1]};
            2'b11: q <= {data[7:0], q[63:8]};
            default: q <= q; // default behavior keeps q unchanged
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the module TopModule takes into account the load, ena, amount, and data inputs to determine the shift operation to be performed. The shift operations are defined based on the amount input, and the shift register is updated accordingly.

I would then further elaborate on this implementation by adding any necessary testbenches, simulations, and verification to ensure the correctness and functionality of the module before integrating it into a larger design.
