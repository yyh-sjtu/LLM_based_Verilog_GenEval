Sure, here is an RTL description of the TopModule module implementing the functionality you described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input [7:0] anyedge,
    output reg [7:0] out
);

reg [7:0] prev_in;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
        if (prev_in[i] == 1'b0 && in[i] == 1'b1) begin
            out[i] <= 1'b1;
        end else begin
            out[i] <= 1'b0;
        end
    end
    prev_in <= in;
end

endmodule
```

This module will detect any edge transition in the input signal on a per-bit basis and set the corresponding output bit to 1 on the cycle following a 0 to 1 transition. The module uses a register `prev_in` to store the previous value of the input signal to compare against the current input values. The output signal `out` is updated accordingly for each bit.
