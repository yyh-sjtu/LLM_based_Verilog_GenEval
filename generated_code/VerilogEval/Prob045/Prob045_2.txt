Sure, here is the RTL code for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input [7:0] anyedge,
    output reg [7:0] out
);

reg [7:0] prev_in;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    for (int i=0; i<8; i=i+1) begin
        if (in[i] != prev_in[i] && prev_in[i] == 0 && in[i] == 1) begin
            out[i] <= 1;
        end else begin
            out[i] <= 0;
        end
    end
    prev_in <= in;
end

endmodule
```

This module detects any edge in the input signal and sets the corresponding bit in the output vector high on the cycle after a 0 to 1 transition occurs. Let me know if you need any further clarification or assistance.
