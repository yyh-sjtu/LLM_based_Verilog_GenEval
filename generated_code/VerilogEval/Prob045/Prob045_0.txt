Below is the implementation of the TopModule in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    input [7:0] anyedge,
    output reg [7:0] edge_detected
);

reg [7:0] prev_in;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Detect any edge in the input signals
    for (int i=0; i<8; i=i+1) begin
        if (prev_in[i] == 1'b0 && in[i] == 1'b1) begin
            edge_detected[i] <= 1'b1;
        end else begin
            edge_detected[i] <= 1'b0;
        end
    end
    
    prev_in <= in;
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the module TopModule takes in the clock signal, an 8-bit input vector named 'in', and another 8-bit vector 'anyedge'. The module detects any edge in the input signal by comparing the current input value with the previous input value stored in 'prev_in'. If a 0 to 1 transition is detected for any bit in the input vector, the corresponding bit in 'edge_detected' is set to 1 in the next clock cycle. The sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
