Sure, here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing a 2-input NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input in1,
    input in2,
    output reg out
);

always @(*) begin
    out = ~(in1 | in2);
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named "TopModule" with input ports "in1" and "in2" and output port "out". The output "out" is calculated as the logical NOR operation of inputs "in1" and "in2".
