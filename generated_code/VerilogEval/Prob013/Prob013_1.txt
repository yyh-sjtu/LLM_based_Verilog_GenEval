Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for a module named `TopModule` that implements a 2-input NOR gate. The module has two input ports (`in1` and `in2`) and one output port (`out`).

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in1,
    input wire in2,
    output wire out
);

// Implementing the NOR gate functionality
assign out = ~(in1 | in2); // out is the NOR of in1 and in2

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is declared with the name `TopModule` and specifies the input and output ports.
- **Input Ports**: `in1` and `in2` are declared as `input wire`, which means they are one-bit wide input signals.
- **Output Port**: `out` is declared as `output wire`, which means it is a one-bit wide output signal.
- **NOR Gate Logic**: The output `out` is assigned to the negation of the logical OR of `in1` and `in2`, fulfilling the requirement of a NOR gate.

### Simulation and Testing
To ensure proper functionality, you may want to create a testbench to simulate this module. Would you like assistance with that?
