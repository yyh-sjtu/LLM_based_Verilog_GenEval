As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input x,
    input y,
    output z
);

assign z = (x ^ y) & x;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named TopModule with input ports x and y, and an output port z. The boolean function z = (x^y) & x is implemented using the assign statement, which calculates the XOR between x and y, and then takes the AND operation with x to produce the output z.
