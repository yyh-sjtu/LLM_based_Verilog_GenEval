Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for a module named `TopModule` that implements the specified boolean function \( z = (x \oplus y) \land x \).

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire x,
    input wire y,
    output wire z
);
    // Internal signal to hold the result of the XOR operation
    wire xor_result;

    // Compute the XOR of x and y
    assign xor_result = x ^ y;

    // Compute z = (x ^ y) & x
    assign z = xor_result & x;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has two input ports (`x` and `y`), and one output port (`z`).
- **XOR Operation**: The result of the XOR operation between `x` and `y` is stored in the internal wire `xor_result`.
- **AND Operation**: The output `z` is obtained by performing an AND operation between `xor_result` and `x`.

### Usage:
You can instantiate this module in a testbench or any other module to see its functionality. Ensure to simulate and test to confirm that it works as expected. Let me know if you need further assistance!
