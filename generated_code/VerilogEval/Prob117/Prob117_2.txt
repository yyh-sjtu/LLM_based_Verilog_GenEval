Based on the provided simulation waveforms, we can infer the behavior of the `TopModule`. The output `q` evolves as follows:

- Initially, at time 0, `q` is undefined (`x`).
- When `a = 1`, the output `q` remains stable at 4 (binary `100`) for several clock cycles.
- When `a` transitions to `0`, we see different steps where specific values of `q` increase or reset.
- The output `q` seems to be a counter or state machine that changes states based on the `a` input and the rising clock edge.

From the waveform data, the following points can be summarized about the functionality of the module:
- The output `q` remains at `4` as long as the input `a` is high (`1`).
- When `a` goes low (`0`), the value of `q` seems to increment or reset after multiple clock cycles.

We will build a sequential circuit for `TopModule` that behaves like the given data using a simple FSM logic. The current state will be held in a 3-bit register for `q`. 

Here's a Verilog implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire a,
    output reg [2:0] q
);

    // Internal state
    reg [2:0] next_state;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Transition to the next state
        q <= next_state;
    end

    always @* begin
        // Default next state
        next_state = q;

        case (next_state)        
            3'b100: begin  // State 4
                if (a == 1'b1)
                    next_state = 3'b100; // Remain in state 4
                else
                    next_state = 3'b100; // Stay in state 4 for at least one cycle
            end
            3'b000: begin // State 0
                if (a == 1'b1)
                    next_state = 3'b100; // Goes to state 4 when a is 1
                else
                    next_state = 3'b000; // Remain in state 0
            end
            // Handle other states based on transitioning logic derived from the observed waveform
            default: begin
                if (a == 1'b1) 
                    next_state = 3'b100; // Go to state 4
                else
                    next_state = next_state + 1'b1; // Increment state 
            end
        endcase
    end

    initial begin
        q = 3'b000; // Initialize output
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Representation**: The output `q` is a 3-bit register representing values ranging from `0` to `7`.
2. **Clock Trigger**: On every rising clock edge, the current state `q` is updated based on the `next_state`.
3. **Next State Logic**: 
   - When `a = 1`, keep `q` in state `4` (binary `100`).
   - When `a = 0`, transition to the next state based on default incrementing behavior, resetting at certain conditions.
4. **Initialization**: `q` is initialized to `0` (`3'b000`).

This code serves as a starting point and might need further refinements based on any corner cases identified in specific implementations or tests; adjust accordingly based on actual requirements or specific behaviors you observe.
