To implement the `TopModule` based on the provided simulation waveforms, we first need to infer the behavior of the circuit from the state transitions observed in the output `q`. The output `q` appears to represent a 3-bit counter with specific characteristics based on the input `a`.

### Analyzing the Waveforms:
- The initial value of `q` is undefined (`x`).
- Within the first few clock cycles, `q` generally remains at 4 during certain states, indicating that it may hold its value under certain conditions.
- The value of `q` increments or resets based on the values of `a`:
  - It counts up when `a` is `1`.
  - It resets to `0` when `a` is `0` and after some conditions are met.

### Sequence Behavior:
- **When `a` is `1`**:
  - `q` remains `4` for several cycles.
  - It increments upon certain conditions (for instance, when switching between `0` and `1` on `a`).
- **When `a` is `0`**:
  - After `0`, there are certain cycles when it captures previous values.
  - Eventually, it returns to `0` upon certain transitions.

#### Observed Logic:
- If `clk` goes high and `a` is `1`, increment the value of `q` (wrapping around since it's 3 bits).
- If `clk` goes high and `a` is `0`, reset `q` to `0`.

### Verilog Implementation:
Here's a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as inferred from the analysis above:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    output reg [2:0] q
);

// Sequential logic
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a) begin
        q <= (q + 1) % 8; // Increment q and wrap around at 8 (since it's 3 bits)
    end else begin
        q <= 0; // Reset to 0 when a is 0
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input and Output**: The module has one clock input (`clk`), one single-bit input (`a`), and a 3-bit output (`q`).
- **Always Block**: The behavior is defined within an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
- **Condition for Increment or Reset**:
  - If `a` is high, `q` increments. The modulo operation ensures it wraps around when it reaches `8` (i.e., `000` in binary).
  - If `a` is low, `q` is reset to `0`.

This design meets the specification provided through the simulation waveforms, implementing the observed behavior logically.
