Sure! To implement the `TopModule` sequential circuit described in the simulation waveform, we need to consider the behavior of the output `q` with respect to the input signals `clk` and `a`. 

### Observations from the Waveform:

1. The output `q` is 3 bits and can represent values from `0` to `7`.
2. The output latches the value `4` during most of the `clk` cycles while `a` is `1` (which means it remains unchanged when `a` is `1`).
3. When `a` transitions to `0`, the output changes after certain transitions of `clk`.
4. The output `q` seems to increment when `a` is `0` after a series of `1`s are registered and decrements back to `0` at some point.

From this, we can infer that `q` represents some kind of counter behavior influenced by the input `a`.

### Design Specification:
- When `a` is `1`, hold the current value of `q`.
- When `a` is `0`, increment `q` in response to `clk`.
- If `q` reaches `7`, it should wrap around to `0`.

### RTL Implementation in Verilog:
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  a,
    output reg [2:0] q
);
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (a) begin
            // Keep current value when a is 1
            q <= q;  // Redundant, can be omitted but keeps same value
        end else begin
            // Increment q when a is 0, with wrap-around at 7
            if (q == 3'b111) begin
                q <= 3'b000; // Wrap-around
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the calculations happen with each rising edge of the clock signal.
2. Inside the block:
   - If `a` is high (`1`), the current value of `q` remains unchanged.
   - If `a` is low (`0`), `q` is incremented, and if it reaches `7` (binary `3'b111`), it wraps to `0`.
3. The output `q` is declared as a `reg` type since it will be written asynchronously in the `always` block.

This implementation should replicate the behavior observed in the given simulation waveforms.
