To implement the `TopModule` as specified, we need to analyze the given simulation waveforms to understand how the output `q` is generated based on the clock `clk` and the input `a`.

From the waveform data:
- The output `q` appears to be incremented under certain conditions depending on the state of `a`.
- It holds the value of `4` for several clock cycles, then incrementally changes upon specific transitions of the input `a`.

### Observation and Decoding Logic:
1. **Initial State** (0ns):
   - At reset (0 ns), `q` is undefined (x).
   
2. **Count Behavior**:
   - When `a` is `1`: `q` remains `4` until `a` transitions to `0` and then increments when `a` is `1` again.
   - When `a` is `0`: `q` retains its value until `a` returns to `1`, at which point it increments.

3. **Incrementing Value**:
   - The value increments based on the transitions of `a` while holding certain conditions across clock cycles.

4. **Final Count Logic**:
   - At cycle transitions where `a` flips to `0`, the circuit may hold its current value until a condition prompts it to increment at the next `1` of `a`.
   
Based on these observations, here is a possible RTL implementation in Verilog:

### Verilog Implementation
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,    // Clock input
    input a,      // Input signal
    output reg [2:0] q // 3-bit output
);
    initial begin
        q = 3'b000; // Initialize q to 0
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (a) begin
            // Count increments based on specific state transitions.
            case (q)
                3'b000: q <= 3'b001; // Transition from 0 to 1 on first 'a' = 1
                3'b001: q <= 3'b010; // Proceed to counting up
                3'b010: q <= 3'b011; // Continue counting
                3'b011: q <= 3'b100; // Hit 4
                3'b100: q <= 3'b100; // Hold on 4 while a = 1
                3'b101: q <= 3'b110; // Go to 6 on new 1
                3'b110: q <= 3'b000; // Reset after some logic
                3'b111: q <= 3'b000; // Arbitrary reset or cycle
                default: q <= q; // Hold current state if not specified
            endcase
        end
        // If a is 0, we might want to hold the value of q
        // or have some other logic depending on specific requirements
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The module described has sequential logic that triggers on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`).
- The output (`q`) is declared as a 3-bit register to hold the state.
- The logic inside the `always` block depends on the value of `a` and `q` upon each rising clock edge, implementing a state machine that produces the output sequence based on the examined waveform data.
- Ensure to handle cases and define transitions appropriately to get the desired behavior per your project requirements and testing setup.

You can further refine the conditions based on specific behavior not listed in the waveforms if there are more detailed specifications on state transitions or reset behavior.
