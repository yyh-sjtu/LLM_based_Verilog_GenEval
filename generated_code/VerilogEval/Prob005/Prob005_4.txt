Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a `TopModule` in Verilog that implements a NOT gate. The module has a single one-bit input (`in`) and a single one-bit output (`out`), where `out` is the logical negation of `in`.

Here is the Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in,  // 1-bit input
    output wire out // 1-bit output
);

    // Implementing the NOT gate
    assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule`, and its input and output ports are defined within parentheses.
- **Input Declaration**: The input `in` is declared as a one-bit wire.
- **Output Declaration**: The output `out` is declared as a one-bit wire.
- **Assign Statement**: The `assign` statement is used to implement the NOT operation, where the output `out` is assigned the negation of the input `in` using the bitwise NOT operator (`~`).

### Usage
You can instantiate this module in a testbench or another module as needed to verify its functionality. If you have any other requests or require further modifications, feel free to ask!
