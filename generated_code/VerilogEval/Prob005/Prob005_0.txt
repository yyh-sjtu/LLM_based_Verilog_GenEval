Certainly! Below is a simple Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that behaves as a NOT gate.

```verilog
// TopModule implementation as a NOT gate
module TopModule (
    input wire in,   // Input signal
    output wire out  // Output signal (NOT of input)
);

// Implementing NOT gate functionality
assign out = ~in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The `TopModule` is declared with input and output ports.
- **Input Port**: `in` is a one-bit input signal.
- **Output Port**: `out` is a one-bit output signal.
- **Logic Implementation**: The `assign` statement uses the bitwise NOT operator `~` to produce the output by inverting the input.

### Simulation and Testing:
You can test this module using a testbench that applies various input values to verify that the output is correct (i.e., when `in = 0`, `out = 1` and when `in = 1`, `out = 0`).

Feel free to ask if you require further enhancements or additional features!
