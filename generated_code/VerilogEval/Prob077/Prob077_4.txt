Sure, here is the Verilog implementation of the TopModule module with a circuit as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out,
    output out_n
);

wire and1_out, and2_out;

and gate1 (and1_out, a, b);
and gate2 (and2_out, c, d);
or gate3 (out, and1_out, and2_out);
not gate4 (out_n, out);

endmodule
```

This code defines the TopModule module with the specified input and output ports. It creates two intermediate wires, `and1_out` and `and2_out`, to connect the AND gates to the OR gate. The AND gates connect the input signals `a` and `b`, `c` and `d` respectively. The OR gate then combines the outputs of the AND gates to produce the `out` signal. Finally, the NOT gate inverts the `out` signal to generate the `out_n` signal.
