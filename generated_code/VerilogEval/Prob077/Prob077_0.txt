Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out,
    output out_n
);

wire intermediate_wire1;
wire intermediate_wire2;

assign intermediate_wire1 = a & b;
assign intermediate_wire2 = c & d;
assign out = intermediate_wire1 | intermediate_wire2;
assign out_n = ~out;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements the circuit as described, with two intermediate wires connecting the AND gates in the first layer to the OR gate in the second layer. The output 'out' is the result of OR gate and the inverted output 'out_n' is the negation of 'out'. This module can be instantiated in a larger design to perform the specified logic operation.
