Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule implementing the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out,
    output out_n
);

wire and_output_1;
wire and_output_2;

assign and_output_1 = a & b;
assign and_output_2 = c & d;

assign out = and_output_1 | and_output_2;
assign out_n = ~out;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs, as well as the intermediate wires to connect the AND and OR gates. The logic for AND gates and OR gate is implemented using bitwise operators, and the output 'out_n' is generated by inverting the output 'out'. This module successfully implements the desired circuit structure.
