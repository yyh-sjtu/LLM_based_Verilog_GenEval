Sure, here is a Verilog implementation of the TopModule with the specified interface and 8 D flip-flops triggered by the positive edge of the clock:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

reg [7:0] q_next;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q <= q_next;
end

always @* begin
    q_next = d;
end

endmodule
```

This module includes 8 D flip-flops triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal. The input data is stored in the `q_next` register and then transferred to the output `q` register on the next clock edge.
