Sure! Below is a simple implementation of a module named `TopModule` that includes 8 D flip-flops (DFFs). The flip-flops are triggered by the positive edge of the clock and are used to latch the input data `d`, producing an output `q`.

Here's the Verilog code for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    // 8 D flip-flops
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d; // On the positive edge of the clock, output q will follow input d
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - `module TopModule` defines the module named `TopModule`.
   - It includes input ports (`clk` and `d`) and an output port (`q`).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - `input clk`: A 1-bit input for the clock signal.
   - `input [7:0] d`: An 8-bit input data bus.
   - `output reg [7:0] q`: An 8-bit output data bus. The `reg` keyword is used because `q` will hold the value assigned to it after the clock edge.

3. **Always Block**:
   - `always @(posedge clk)`: This block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` input, meaning the code inside will run when the clock transitions from low to high.
   - Inside the block, `q <= d;` assigns the value of `d` to `q` at every positive clock edge.

### Simulation and Synthesis:
This simple design can be synthesized into hardware and simulated using various simulation tools to verify functionality. You would generally create a testbench to validate that the flip-flops capture and hold the input data correctly at the rising edge of the clock.
