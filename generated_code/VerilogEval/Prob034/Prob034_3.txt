Here is the RTL code for the TopModule with the specified interface and functionality:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

reg [7:0] q_reg;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q_reg <= d;
end

assign q = q_reg;

endmodule
```

In this code, the 8-bit input signal `d` is directly loaded into the 8-bit output signal `q` on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The output `q` is registered in the `q_reg` register, which updates its value synchronously with the clock signal.
