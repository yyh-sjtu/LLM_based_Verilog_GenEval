The provided implementation of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer (`mux`) has a bug in the output assignment. Currently, the output `out` is defined as a single bit, whereas it should be an 8-bit wide output to correctly represent the selected input. 

To fix this, you need to modify the output type of `out` to be 8 bits instead of a single bit. Here's the corrected module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    assign out = (~sel & a) | (sel & b);

endmodule
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Output Declaration**: Changed the output declaration from `output` to `output [7:0] out` to ensure it's an 8-bit wide output.
2. **No changes to the logic**: The logic for selecting between `a` and `b` remains unchanged as it was technically correct; it just needed to be applied to an 8-bit output.

This corrected module will work as expected, properly selecting an 8-bit value from either `a` or `b` based on the `sel` input.
