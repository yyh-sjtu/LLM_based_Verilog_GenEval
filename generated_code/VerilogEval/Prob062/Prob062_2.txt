The provided implementation of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer has a bug because the output `out` is defined as a single bit rather than combining the 8 bits from inputs `a` and `b`. Each bit of the output should correspond to the selected input based on the `sel` bit. The output should also be an 8-bit vector, not a single bit.

Here's the corrected implementation of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The module has been updated to declare `out` as an 8-bit vector (`output [7:0] out`).
- The output is now determined using a conditional (ternary) operator: if `sel` is 1, `out` will take the value of `b`; if `sel` is 0, `out` will take the value of `a`.
- This ensures that all bits of the selected input are passed to the output correctly.
