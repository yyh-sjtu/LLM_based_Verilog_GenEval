The implementation of the 8-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) you provided has a logical error because the output `out` is declared as a single bit (`output out`), while it should be an 8-bit output to match the sizes of inputs `a` and `b`. The correct implementation should combine the selection logic properly across all bits of the input vectors.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the `TopModule` that fixes the bug:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out // Changed from single bit to 8 bits
);

    assign out = (~sel) ? a : b; // Use the conditional (ternary) operator for clarity

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Output Declaration**: The output has been changed from a single bit (`output out`) to an 8-bit vector (`output [7:0] out`).
2. **Multiplexing Logic**: The logic has been updated to use the conditional (ternary) operator for clarity, which checks the value of `sel`. If `sel` is low (`0`), then `a` is selected; if `sel` is high (`1`), then `b` is selected.

This implementation ensures that the output `out` correctly represents the selected input (either `a` or `b`) across all 8 bits.
