As a professional RTL designer, I would make the necessary corrections to ensure the functionality of the 2-to-1 mux module. 

Here is the corrected implementation of the 8-bit 2-to-1 mux module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input        sel,
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [7:0] out
);

    assign out = (sel == 1'b0) ? a : b;

endmodule
```

In this corrected version, I have used a ternary operator to properly select between input 'a' and 'b' based on the value of 'sel'. This implementation ensures correct operation of the 2-to-1 mux module.
