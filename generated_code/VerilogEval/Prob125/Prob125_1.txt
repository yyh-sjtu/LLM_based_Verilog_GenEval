To implement the `TopModule` that satisfies the given Karnaugh map, we need to derive the logic function based on the entries in the map. Here's how the K-map looks after arranging the outputs:

```
              ab
   cd   01  00  10  11
   00 | d | 0 | 1 | 1 |
   01 | 0 | 0 | d | d |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
```

**Interpretation of the Karnaugh Map:**
- The positions where '1' occurs correspond to combinations of the inputs that should yield an output of '1'.
- The 'd' (don't-care) conditions can be optimized as needed.
- From the map, we can deduce the following minterms for output `out = 1`:

- From the rows:
   - **cd=00, ab=10 (c=0, d=0, a=1, b=0)** -> 1 
   - **cd=00, ab=11 (c=0, d=0, a=1, b=1)** -> 1 
   - **cd=10, ab=01 (c=1, d=0, a=0, b=1)** -> 1 
   - **cd=10, ab=10 (c=1, d=0, a=1, b=0)** -> 1 
   - **cd=10, ab=11 (c=1, d=0, a=1, b=1)** -> 1 

Thus, the optimal combination for `out` can be expressed in terms of the inputs:

### Logical Expression Derived:
From the K-map:
- The combination of `out` can be determined by:
1. When \( c = 1 \): regardless of `a` or `b`, the output becomes 1.
2. When \( c = 0 \) and \( a = 1 \) and \( b \) can be either 0 or 1, the output is also 1.

Hence the logic equation is:
\[ \text{out} = c + (a \cdot \overline{b}) + (a \cdot b) \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ \text{out} = c + a \]

### Verilog Implementation
Here's the Verilog code for the `TopModule` based on the derived logic:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire  a,
    input wire  b,
    input wire  c,
    input wire  d, // 'd' is a don't-care input
    output wire out
);

// Logic implementation
assign out = c | a; // out is true if either c is true or a is true

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `assign` statement computes the output based on the conditions derived from the K-map.
- The `d` input is not used in this implementation since it represents a don't-care condition, and the function does not depend on it.
