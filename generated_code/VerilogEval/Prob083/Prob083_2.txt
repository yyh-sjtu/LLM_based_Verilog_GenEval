As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input x,
    input y,
    output reg z
);

always @(x, y)
begin
    case ({x, y})
        2'b00: z = 1;
        2'b01: z = 0;
        2'b10: z = 0;
        2'b11: z = 1;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code represents the TopModule module with input ports x and y, and output port z. The module contains a combinational logic block that determines the value of z based on the values of x and y using a case statement. The waveform provided in the description should be reproduced by this implementation.
