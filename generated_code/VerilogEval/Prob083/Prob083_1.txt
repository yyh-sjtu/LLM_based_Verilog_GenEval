To implement the `TopModule` according to the specified waveform, we need to deduce the relationship between the inputs (`x` and `y`) and the output (`z`). The output `z` is generated according to specific states of the input signals over the time periods described in the waveform.

Here's a breakdown of the timing behavior:

1. From **0 to 20 ns**: `z` is **1** when both `x` and `y` are **0**.
2. From **25 to 30 ns**: `z` is **0** when `x` is **1** and `y` is **0**.
3. From **35 to 40 ns**: `z` is **0** when `x` is **0** and `y` is **1**.
4. From **45 to 55 ns**: `z` is **1** when `x` is **1** and `y` is **1**.
5. From **60 to 75 ns**: `z` is **0** when `x` is **0** and `y` is **1** (similar to previous condition).
6. Finally, at **90 ns**: `z` becomes **0** again when `x` is **1** and `y` is **0**.

From this behavior, we can derive the logic for `z`:

- `z` will be **1** when either `x` and `y` are both zero, or `x` and `y` are both one.
- `z` will be **0** otherwise.

Thus, we can express `z` logically as:
- \( z = \neg (x \oplus y) \) (where \( \oplus \) is XOR)

However, to implement this accurately and directly, we can also rewrite the logic conditions as:
- **1 if \( (x, y) = (0, 0) \) or \( (1, 1) \)**
- **0 otherwise**

Here is the RTL code for the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire x,
    input wire y,
    output wire z
);

    // z is 1 when both inputs are either 0 or 1, and 0 otherwise
    assign z = (~x & ~y) | (x & y);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Declaration**: We declare the input ports `x` and `y` as `wire` type inputs.
2. **Output Declaration**: The output port `z` is declared as a `wire` type.
3. **Logic Expression**: The output `z` is derived using an assign statement which evaluates to 1 if either both `x` and `y` are 0, or both are 1.

### Simulation:
You can simulate this module with a testbench to confirm that the output `z` behaves according to the specified waveform timing diagram. Make sure to properly initialize your input signals and provide enough time for toggling the inputs to observe the output transitions accurately.
