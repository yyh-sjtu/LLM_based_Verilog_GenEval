To implement the `TopModule` based on the given waveform specifications, we can identify the behavior of the output `z` based on the values of inputs `x` and `y` over time. Here's the summarized behavior from the waveform:

1. **During the first 20ns**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`.
2. **From 25ns to 30ns**: `x = 1`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`.
3. **From 35ns to 40ns**: `x = 0`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`.
4. **From 45ns to 50ns**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`.
5. **From 55ns to 60ns**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`.
6. **From 60ns to 70ns (60-70)**: `x = 0`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0` (from 60ns to 65ns then 70ns has both conditions checked).
7. **From 70ns to 80ns (70-80)**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`.
8. **At 90ns**: `x = 1`, `y = 0`, and `z = 0`.

### RTL Implementation:

The behavior can be implemented using a combinational logic block based on the above observations. Hereâ€™s a Verilog code snippet implementing `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire x,
    input wire y,
    output reg z
);

// Combinational logic to determine z based on x and y inputs
always @(*) begin
    // Default state
    z = 0;

    case ({x, y})
        2'b00: z = 1; // When x=0, y=0 -> z=1 (0-20ns and 55-60ns)
        2'b01: z = 0; // When x=0, y=1 -> z=0 (35-40ns and 60-70ns)
        2'b10: z = 0; // When x=1, y=0 -> z=0 (25-30ns and 90ns)
        2'b11: z = 1; // When x=1, y=1 -> z=1 (45-50ns and 70-80ns)
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the RTL Code:

1. **Input and Output Declaration**: The module defines two input wires for `x` and `y`, and one output register `z`.
2. **Always Block**: The always block is sensitive to any change in `x` or `y`. This block evaluates the output `z` based on the combination of `x` and `y`.
3. **Case Statement**: A case statement checks the combination of `x` and `y` and assigns the appropriate value to `z` based on the conditions derived from the simulation waveform provided.

This implementation captures the state of the output `z` correctly for the different combinations of the inputs `x` and `y` as described in the waveform.
