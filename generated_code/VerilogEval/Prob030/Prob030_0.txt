Certainly! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that performs population count for a 255-bit wide input vector. The output is an 8-bit value representing the count of '1's.

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [254:0] in,  // 255-bit input
    output [7:0] out     // 8-bit output
);

    // Internal signal to hold the population count
    reg [7:0] count;

    // Always block to calculate population count on input change
    always @(*) begin
        // Initialize count to 0
        count = 0;

        // Count the number of '1's in the input vector
        integer i;
        for (i = 0; i < 255; i = i + 1) begin
            count = count + in[i];
        end
    end

    // Assign the calculated count to the output
    assign out = count;

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **Module Interface**:
    - The module named `TopModule` has a 255-bit input named `in` and an 8-bit output named `out`.

2. **Population Count Logic**:
    - A register `count` of size 8 bits is declared to store the number of '1's counted.
    - An always block is triggered every time there's a change on the input `in`.
    - The loop iterates over each bit of the input vector counting '1's by incrementing the `count` variable whenever `in[i]` is '1'.

3. **Output Assignment**:
    - The `count` is continuously assigned to the output `out`.

### Synthesis Considerations
- This simple approach is sufficient for small input vectors like 255 bits; however, for larger inputs or performance-critical applications, more efficient population count techniques like parallel reduction or using specific hardware instructions may be necessary.
