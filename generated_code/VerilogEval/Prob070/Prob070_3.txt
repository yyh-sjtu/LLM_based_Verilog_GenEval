As a professional RTL designer, I will start by analyzing the input conditions for the desired outputs. The output `out_sop` should be high when inputs a,b,c,d correspond to the numbers 2, 7, or 15, and low for numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, or 14. This can be represented as follows:

out_sop = (a&b&~c&~d) | (~a&b&c&d) | (a&~b&~c&d) | (~a&~b&~c&~d)

To minimize this expression further, we can observe that it consists of separate terms for each of the desired numbers. Next, I will determine the output `out_pos` in minimum product-of-sums form. The product-of-sums form can be found by taking the complement of the simplified sum-of-products expression:

out_pos = ~(out_sop)

By using De Morgan's laws, we can simplify the expression for `out_pos` as follows:

out_pos = (~a|~b|c|d) & (a|~b|c|~d) & (~a|b|c|d) & (a|b|~c|~d)

Therefore, the RTL implementation of the module TopModule with the required interface and logic can be achieved by implementing the above expressions for `out_sop` and `out_pos`. This will ensure that the module generates the correct outputs based on the specified input conditions.
