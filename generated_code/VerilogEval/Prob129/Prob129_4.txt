To implement the TopModule with the specified interface and functionality, I will design a Mealy-type finite state machine with 3 states that recognizes the sequence "101" on the input signal x. The output signal z will be asserted to logic-1 when the sequence is detected, and the state machine will have a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset.

Here is a high-level overview of the state machine logic:

State 0:
- Transition to State 1 when x transitions from 0 to 1

State 1:
- Transition to State 2 when x transitions from 0 to 1
- Transition back to State 0 when x transitions from 1 to 0
- Assert z to 1 when x transitions from 0 to 1 in this state

State 2:
- Transition back to State 0 when x transitions from 1 to 0
- Assert z to 1 when x transitions from 0 to 1 in this state

I will now proceed to implement the RTL design for the TopModule module based on this logic. Let me know if you have any specific requirements or constraints that need to be considered during the design process.
