Sure! Below is an example implementation of a module named `TopModule`, which functions as a 1-bit wide 256-to-1 multiplexer. The module takes a 256-bit input vector and an 8-bit selection input, and outputs a single 1-bit value based on the selected input.

Hereâ€™s the Verilog code for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [255:0] in,  // 256-bit input vector
    input  [7:0]   sel, // 8-bit select input
    output         out   // 1-bit output
);

// Assign the output to the selected input bit
assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration:** 
   - The module is declared with the name `TopModule`.
   - It has three ports: `in` (256 bits), `sel` (8 bits), and `out` (1 bit).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The `in` input port is a 256-bit wide vector that contains the 256 inputs.
   - The `sel` input is an 8-bit selector that can take values from 0 to 255 (which maps to the 256 bits in the `in` vector).
   - The `out` output is a single bit that corresponds to the selected input.

3. **Functional Logic:**
   - The `assign` statement directly maps the selected bit from `in` to `out` based on the value of `sel`. For example, if `sel` is 0, `out` will be `in[0]`; if `sel` is 1, `out` will be `in[1]`, and so forth.

### Synthesis:
This design is straightforward and can be synthesized effectively in modern digital synthesis tools, as it uses simple data flow techniques to directly select bits from the input vector.
