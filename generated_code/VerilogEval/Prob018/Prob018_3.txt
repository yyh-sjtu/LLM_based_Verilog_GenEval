Certainly! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule`, which is a 1-bit wide 256-to-1 multiplexer in RTL (Register Transfer Level) style using Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [255:0] in,  // 256-bit input vector
    input  [7:0]   sel, // 8-bit select signal
    output         out   // 1-bit output
);

// Assign the output based on the selected input
assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `in`: A 256-bit vector that holds the input values.
   - `sel`: An 8-bit select signal that determines which bit of the input vector is routed to the output.
   - `out`: A single-bit output that will carry the selected value.

2. **Functionality**:
   - The `assign` statement connects the output `out` directly to the specific bit of the `in` vector that corresponds to the value of `sel`. Since `sel` is 8 bits wide, it can select any value from 0 to 255, thus covering all 256 bits of the `in` vector.

### Usage:

This module can be instantiated in a larger design and will function as a multiplexer where the `sel` input dynamically chooses which bit from the `in` input is passed to the `out` output. The design is straightforward and efficient, utilizing direct bit selection for minimal latency and area.
