Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule`, which acts as a 256-to-1 multiplexer for the specified inputs and outputs.

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [255:0] in,  // 256-bit input
    input  [7:0]   sel, // 8-bit select input
    output         out   // 1-bit output
);

    // Assign the output based on the select line
    assign out = in[sel];

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Ports:**
   - `in`: A 256-bit wide input vector. It can hold values `in[0]` through `in[255]`.
   - `sel`: An 8-bit selective input that determines which bit from `in` to output.

2. **Output Port:**
   - `out`: A 1-bit output that will hold the value of the selected bit from the `in` vector.

### Functionality
The module works by using the `sel` input to select the corresponding bit from the `in` vector using simple array indexing. The `assign` statement performs a direct mapping from the selected index to the output. 

### Usage
To use this module in a testbench or larger design, instantiate it with appropriate signals for `in`, `sel`, and `out`. Ensure that the `sel` input does not exceed 255, as that could lead to unexpected behavior because `sel` is only 8 bits wide.

### Simulation and Synthesis
This code should work correctly in both simulation and synthesis (FPGA/ASIC) as it makes good use of Verilog's continuous assignment capabilities and simple indexing. Ensure to test it thoroughly to confirm that the proper bit is output based on `sel`.
