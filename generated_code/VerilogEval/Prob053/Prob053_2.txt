Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as per the specifications you've provided:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,  // Clock input
    input  wire in,   // Input signal
    output reg out    // Output signal
);
    // An internal wire to hold the output of the XOR gate
    wire xor_out;

    // XOR gate taking 'in' and 'out' as inputs
    assign xor_out = in ^ out;

    // D flip-flop triggered on the positive edge of clk
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= xor_out; // D flip-flop takes input from XOR output
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
    - `clk`: the clock signal that triggers the flip-flop.
    - `in`: the input signal which will be one of the inputs to the XOR gate.
    - `out`: the output of the flip-flop, which is also one of the inputs to the XOR gate.

2. **XOR Gate**:
    - The XOR gate combines `in` and `out`, producing a result `xor_out`.

3. **D Flip-Flop**:
    - The output `out` is updated on the rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), where it takes the value of `xor_out`.

### Additional Notes:
- There is no reset line in this design, as per your requirements.
- This module will continuously update the output based on the XOR operation of the current input `in` and the output `out` from the previous clock cycle.
- This design assumes you will synthesize this in an FPGA or ASIC where proper clocking and timing constraints will be verified.

Feel free to ask if you have any other specifications or modifications in mind!
