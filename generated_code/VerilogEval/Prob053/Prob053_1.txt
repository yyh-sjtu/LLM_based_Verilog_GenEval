Here is the RTL code for the TopModule as per the given requirements:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input in,
    output reg out
);

reg flop_out;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    flop_out <= in ^ out;
    out <= flop_out;
end

endmodule
```

This code defines the TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs. The module includes a D flip-flop triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal and an XOR gate that takes the 'in' input along with the output of the flip-flop. The output of the XOR gate feeds back into the flip-flop and drives the output 'out' of the module.
