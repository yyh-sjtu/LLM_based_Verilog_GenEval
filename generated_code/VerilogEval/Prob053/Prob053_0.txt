Sure! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as per your specifications. The module consists of a D flip-flop and a two-input XOR gate. The output of the XOR gate is connected to the D input of the flip-flop, while the output of the flip-flop functions as one of the inputs for the XOR gate.

Here's the code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input in,
    output reg out
);

// Temporary wire to hold the result of the XOR operation
wire xor_out;

// Instantiate the XOR gate
assign xor_out = in ^ out;

// D Flip-Flop implementation
always @(posedge clk) begin
    out <= xor_out;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The module takes `clk` as the clock input, `in` as the data input, and provides `out` as the output.

2. **XOR Gate**:
   - It computes `xor_out` as the XOR of `in` and the current value of `out`.

3. **D Flip-Flop**:
   - It captures the value of `xor_out` on the positive edge of the `clk` and updates the value of `out`.

### Usage:
- This module can be instantiated in a larger design. You can connect it to a clock signal and provide an input signal to observe how it behaves with respect to the specified logic. The internal state of `out` will toggle based on the values of `in` and the previous state of `out` due to the XOR operation. There is no reset mechanism as specified.
