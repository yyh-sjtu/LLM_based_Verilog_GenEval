Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog. This module consists of a D flip-flop that uses the output of a two-input XOR gate as its input. The XOR gate takes the input signal `in` and the output of the flip-flop `out`.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,    // Clock input
    input  wire in,     // Input signal
    output reg  out     // Output signal
);

    // Internal signal for the XOR output
    wire xor_out;

    // XOR gate implementation
    assign xor_out = in ^ out;

    // D Flip-Flop implementation
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out <= xor_out;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Ports Declaration**: The module declares its input and output ports according to your specifications.
  
2. **XOR Implementation**: The `xor_out` wire takes the XOR of the `in` signal and the current output `out` of the flip-flop.

3. **D Flip-Flop**: The `always @(posedge clk)` block describes the behavior of the D flip-flop. On every positive edge of the clock signal, the `out` is updated with the value of `xor_out`.

### Usage:
- To instantiate this module in a testbench or another module, simply import it and connect the `clk`, `in`, and `out` signals accordingly.
- The `out` will change its state according to the logic defined (XOR operation with input `in`), synchronized with the clock signal.
