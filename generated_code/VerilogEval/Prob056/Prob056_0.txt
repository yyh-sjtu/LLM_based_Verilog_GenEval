Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog for a JK flip-flop according to the requirements you've described.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  j,
    input  k,
    output reg Q
);

// A register to hold the previous state (Qold)
reg Qold;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Assign Qold to the current Q for the next clock cycle
    Qold <= Q; 
    case ({j, k})
        2'b00: Q <= Qold; // Maintain current state
        2'b01: Q <= 1'b0; // Reset
        2'b10: Q <= 1'b1; // Set
        2'b11: Q <= ~Qold; // Toggle
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration:**
   - The `TopModule` is declared with the inputs `clk`, `j`, and `k` and an output `Q`.

2. **Register Declaration:**
   - `Qold` is declared as a register to hold the previous state of `Q`.

3. **Always Block:**
   - The `always @(posedge clk)` block indicates that the logic within it will execute on the rising edge of the clock signal.
   - Inside the block, we first store the current state of `Q` into `Qold` for use in the next clock cycle.
   - The `case` statement evaluates the concatenation of `j` and `k`:
     - `2'b00`: Retain the previous state (`Qold`).
     - `2'b01`: Set `Q` to `0`.
     - `2'b10`: Set `Q` to `1`.
     - `2'b11`: Toggle `Q` by assigning it the inverse of `Qold` using `~Qold`.

### Summary
This implementation effectively models the behavior of a JK flip-flop as specified in the truth table, and you can integrate this module into a larger design or simulate it for verification.
