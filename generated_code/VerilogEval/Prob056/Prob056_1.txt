To implement a JK flip-flop in RTL (Register Transfer Level) using Verilog, we can define a module named `TopModule` with input ports `clk`, `j`, `k` and an output port `Q`. The behavior of the flip-flop is defined by the truth table you provided. Below is an implementation of the JK flip-flop:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input j,
    input k,
    output reg Q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        case ({j, k})
            2'b00: Q <= Q;      // Do nothing, maintain current state (Qold)
            2'b01: Q <= 1'b0;   // Reset state to 0
            2'b10: Q <= 1'b1;   // Set state to 1
            2'b11: Q <= ~Q;     // Toggle state
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Module Declaration**:
    - The module is named `TopModule` and has inputs `clk`, `j`, `k`, and output `Q`.

2. **Output Declaration**:
    - `Q` is declared as `reg` type since it holds a value that can change inside an always block.

3. **Always Block**:
    - The `always @(posedge clk)` block triggers on the rising edge of the `clk` signal.

4. **Case Statement**:
    - The case statement checks the combination of the inputs `j` and `k`:
        - `2'b00`: The output `Q` retains its previous value (Qold).
        - `2'b01`: The output `Q` is set to `0`.
        - `2'b10`: The output `Q` is set to `1`.
        - `2'b11`: The output `Q` toggles its current state (using `~Q`).

### Usage:
You can instantiate this `TopModule` in a testbench or another module as needed to simulate or synthesize the JK flip-flop behavior in your design.
