As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule as shown below in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input j,
    input k,
    output reg Q
);

reg Qold;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (j && ~k)
        Q <= 1;
    else if (~j && k)
        Q <= 0;
    else if (j && k)
        Q <= ~Qold;
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the module TopModule contains the input ports clk, j, k and the output port Q. Inside the always block sensitive to the posedge of the clock signal, the JK flip-flop logic is implemented according to the specified truth table. The Q output is assigned the appropriate value based on the values of j, k, and the previous output Qold.
