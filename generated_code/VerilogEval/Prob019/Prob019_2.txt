Certainly! In Verilog, you can implement the `TopModule` based on the given specifications using the following code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in1,
    input wire in2,
    output wire out
);

// Implement the circuit: out = in1 AND (NOT in2)
assign out = in1 & ~in2;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The module is defined with two input ports (`in1` and `in2`) and one output port (`out`).
- The logic is implemented using a continuous assignment statement with the `assign` keyword.
- The expression `~in2` represents the bubble (NOT operation) on `in2`.
- The `&` operator is the bitwise AND operation, which performs the AND operation between `in1` and the negation of `in2`.
- Therefore, the output `out` will be high (1) only when `in1` is high (1) and `in2` is low (0).
