Certainly! The description you provided indicates that you want to implement a module where two inputs are sent to an AND gate, but there is an inversion (bubble) on one of the inputs. This means that `in2` should be inverted before being fed into the AND gate.

Here's how you can implement this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in1,
    input wire in2,
    output wire out
);

// Internal wire to hold the inverted in2
wire not_in2;

// Invert in2
assign not_in2 = ~in2;

// AND gate with in1 and inverted in2
assign out = in1 & not_in2;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- We define a module called `TopModule` that has two inputs (`in1` and `in2`) and one output (`out`).
- Inside the module, we declare a wire (`not_in2`) to hold the inverted value of `in2`.
- We use the bitwise NOT operator `~` to invert `in2`.
- Finally, we create the output `out` by ANDing `in1` with the inverted `in2`.

This code implements the desired functionality where `out` is the result of `in1 AND NOT in2`.
