As a professional RTL designer, I would begin by analyzing the waveform data provided to understand the behavior of the circuit. Based on the given waveforms, it appears that the output q is determined based on the input signal a.

To implement the module TopModule with the specified interface, I would write the RTL code in a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL. The code would define the combinational logic that maps the 3-bit input signal a to the 16-bit output signal q as shown in the waveform data.

Here is an example of how the RTL code in Verilog might look like:

```verilog
module TopModule(
  input [2:0] a,
  output reg [15:0] q
);

always @(*)
begin
  case(a)
    3'b000: q = 16'b1232;
    3'b001: q = 16'baee0;
    3'b010: q = 16'b27d4;
    3'b011: q = 16'b5a0e;
    3'b100: q = 16'b2066;
    3'b101: q = 16'b64ce;
    3'b110: q = 16'bc526;
    3'b111: q = 16'b2f19;
    default: q = 16'b1232;
  endcase
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines the TopModule module with a 3-bit input signal a and a 16-bit output signal q. The `case` statement in the `always` block assigns the appropriate 16-bit value to q based on the value of a.

After writing the RTL code, I would proceed to simulate and verify the functionality of the module using a simulation tool. If the simulation results match the expected waveforms, I would consider the module implementation successful.
