To implement the `TopModule` based on the provided simulation waveforms, we can analyze the output `q` for each input `a`. The output needs to be assigned based on the corresponding value of `a`, which is a 3-bit input. This means `a` can take values from 0 to 7.

Based on the provided waveform data, it seems like the output `q` changes based on specific values of `a`. Here's a summary of the values for `a` and their corresponding `q`:

- `a = 0`: `q = 0x04D0` (1232 in decimal)
- `a = 1`: `q = 0xAE0` (aee0 in hex)
- `a = 2`: `q = 0x27D4` (27d4 in hex)
- `a = 3`: `q = 0x5A0E` (5a0e in hex)
- `a = 4`: `q = 0x2066` (2066 in hex)
- `a = 5`: `q = 0x64CE` (64ce in hex)
- `a = 6`: `q = 0xC526` (c526 in hex)
- `a = 7`: `q = 0x2F19` (2f19 in hex)

Now, let's implement this in Verilog as a combinational logic circuit for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [2:0] a, // 3-bit input
    output reg [15:0] q // 16-bit output
);

    always @* begin
        case (a)
            3'b000: q = 16'h04D0; // 1232 in hexadecimal
            3'b001: q = 16'h0AE0; // aee0 in hexadecimal
            3'b010: q = 16'h27D4; // 27d4 in hexadecimal
            3'b011: q = 16'h5A0E; // 5a0e in hexadecimal
            3'b100: q = 16'h2066; // 2066 in hexadecimal
            3'b101: q = 16'h64CE; // 64ce in hexadecimal
            3'b110: q = 16'hC526; // c526 in hexadecimal
            3'b111: q = 16'h2F19; // 2f19 in hexadecimal
            default: q = 16'h0000; // Default case
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. The module `TopModule` takes a 3-bit input `a` and produces a 16-bit output `q`.
2. The `always @*` block specifies that `q` should change whenever the value of `a` changes, making it combinational logic.
3. A `case` statement is used to determine the value of `q` based on the value of `a`.
4. A default case is included to ensure that `q` is initialized to a known value (`0`) if an invalid value is received, though this should not happen with a 3-bit input.

You can simulate this module to confirm that the outputs correspond to the expected values from the waveform analysis.
