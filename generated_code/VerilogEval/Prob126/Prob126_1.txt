To implement the TopModule module with the specified interface and functionality based on the provided simulation waveforms, you can use the following Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [2:0] a,
    output reg [15:0] q
);

always @(*) begin
    case(a)
        3'b000: q = 16'h1232;
        3'b001: q = 16'haee0;
        3'b010: q = 16'h27d4;
        3'b011: q = 16'h5a0e;
        3'b100: q = 16'h2066;
        3'b101: q = 16'h64ce;
        3'b110: q = 16'hc526;
        3'b111: q = 16'h2f19;
        default: q = 16'h0000;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

In this code snippet, the TopModule module takes a 3-bit input `a` and generates a 16-bit output `q` based on the provided simulation waveforms. The `case` statement inside the `always` block maps the input `a` to the corresponding output value according to the given waveforms.

You can copy this Verilog code into your RTL design tool or environment to implement the TopModule module as per the specified requirements. Make sure to perform functional verification and simulation to validate the correctness of the implementation.
