As a professional RTL designer, I would create the TopModule as described below:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input shift_ena,
    input count_ena,
    input data,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

reg [3:0] shift_reg;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (shift_ena) begin
        // Shift in data
        shift_reg <= {data, shift_reg[3:1]};
    end
    
    if (count_ena) begin
        // Decrement the value in the shift register
        shift_reg <= shift_reg - 1;
    end
end

assign q = shift_reg;

endmodule
```

In this Verilog code, I have implemented a four-bit shift register that also acts as a down counter based on the given specifications. The shift register shifts in data on the positive edge of the clock when shift_ena is high, and decrements the value in the shift register on the positive edge of the clock when count_ena is high. The output q is the current value of the shift register.
