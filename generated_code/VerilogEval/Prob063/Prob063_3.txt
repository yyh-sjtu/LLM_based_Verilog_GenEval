Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that meets the requirements you've provided. This module implements a 4-bit shift register that can shift in data or decrement the value, depending on the control signals.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  shift_ena,
    input  count_ena,
    input  data,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (shift_ena) begin
            // Shift in data (most-significant-bit first)
            q <= {data, q[3:1]};
        end else if (count_ena) begin
            // Decrement the value in the register
            if (q != 4'b0000) begin
                q <= q - 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule`, and it has one clock input, three control inputs, and one four-bit output.

2. **Sequential Logic Block**: The `always` block is triggered by the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`).

3. **Control Logic**:
   - **Shift Operation**: If `shift_ena` is high, the `data` bit is shifted into the most significant position of `q`, with the other bits shifted down. This is achieved using the concatenation operator (`{data, q[3:1]}`).
   - **Count Operation**: If `count_ena` is high and the current value of `q` is not zero, `q` is decremented by 1 (`q <= q - 1`).

4. **Output**: The value of `q` is a 4-bit register that reflects the current state of the shift register or counter.

### Additional Notes:
- The design assumes that `shift_ena` and `count_ena` will not be high simultaneously in the specified operational conditions. Therefore, no specific handling is necessary for this case.
- The module needs to be instantiated in a testbench for simulation or synthesized in a hardware description environment for implementation on FPGA or ASIC.
