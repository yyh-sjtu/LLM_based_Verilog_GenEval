Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements a 4-bit shift register with down counting functionality, based on your specified interface. The module utilizes shift operation when `shift_ena` is asserted, and decrements the register when `count_ena` is asserted:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  shift_ena,
    input  count_ena,
    input  data,
    output reg [3:0] q
);
    
    // Initialize q to zero
    initial begin
        q = 4'b0000;
    end

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (shift_ena) begin
            // Shift in the new data MSB first
            q <= {data, q[3:1]};
        end else if (count_ena) begin
            // Down count
            q <= q - 1'b1;
        end
        // If both are enabled, behavior is unspecified
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `clk`: Clock signal, triggering the register updates on the positive edge.
   - `shift_ena`: When high, shifts in a new bit (`data`).
   - `count_ena`: When high, decrements the current value of the register.
   - `data`: The bit to be shifted in.
   - `q`: The 4-bit output register that stores the current state.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The register `q` is initialized to zero at the start using an `initial` block.

3. **Always Block**:
   - The sequential logic is implemented in the `always @(posedge clk)` block, which executes every clock cycle.
   - If `shift_ena` is high, it shifts in the `data` bit into the most significant position, while retaining the remaining bits.
   - If `count_ena` is high, it decrements the value of `q`.
   - The behavior when both `shift_ena` and `count_ena` are high is unspecified per your specifications.

This module will correctly implement the desired functionality of both shifting in data and decrementing the count, depending on which control signal is asserted.
