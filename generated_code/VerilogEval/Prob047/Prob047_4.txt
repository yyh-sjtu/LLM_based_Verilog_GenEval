Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of a module named `TopModule`, which contains 8 D flip-flops with an active high asynchronous reset. When `areset` is high, all flip-flops will reset their outputs to 0. The outputs of these flip-flops are gathered in an 8-bit output port `q`, which reflects the state of the flip-flops on the positive edge of the clock.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire areset,
    input wire [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

    // 8 D flip-flops with asynchronous reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            q <= 8'b00000000; // Reset output to 0
        end else begin
            q <= d; // Transfer input to output
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` declares its input and output ports as specified.
- **Always Block**: The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of the `clk` and the positive edge of `areset`.
  - When `areset` is high, it asynchronously resets the output `q` to `8'b00000000`.
  - When `areset` is not high, on the positive edge of `clk`, it assigns the input `d` to the output `q`.

### Simulation and Testbench:
Ensure you implement a testbench to validate the functionality of this module, checking the operation of the reset and the proper transfer of `d` to `q` on clock edges. Would you like any further assistance on that?
