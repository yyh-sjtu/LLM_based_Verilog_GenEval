Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a Verilog module named `TopModule` that behaves like a wire, meaning that it will output whatever is present on its input.

Hereâ€™s the Verilog code for the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in,   // One bit input
    output wire out  // One bit output
);

    // Assigning the input directly to the output
    assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Definition**: The module is named `TopModule` and the input and output ports are defined with appropriate data types (`input wire` and `output wire`).
- **Behavior**: The `assign` statement continuously drives the output `out` to be equal to the input `in`. This creates the wire-like behavior you requested.

### Usage:
You can instantiate this module in a testbench or another module to observe its behavior as a wire. If you have any further questions or need additional features, feel free to ask!
