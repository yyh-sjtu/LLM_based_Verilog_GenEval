As a professional RTL designer, I would create the implementation of the TopModule as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input in,
    output reg out
);

always @* begin
    out = in;
end

endmodule
```

In this design, the TopModule takes in a single bit input `in` and simply outputs it on the `out` port, effectively behaving like a wire. This implementation is concise and aligned with the specified requirements for the module interface.
