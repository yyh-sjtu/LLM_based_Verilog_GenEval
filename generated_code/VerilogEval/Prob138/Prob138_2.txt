Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` based on the specified state machine. I'll define the states as local parameters, implement the state transition logic in one `always` block, and handle the flip-flops for state storage in another. Lastly, I'll define the output `z` as specified.

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire reset,
    input  wire w,
    output reg  z
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum reg [2:0] {
        A = 3'b000,
        B = 3'b001,
        C = 3'b010,
        D = 3'b011,
        E = 3'b100,
        F = 3'b101
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always @* begin
        case (current_state)
            A: begin
                if (w) 
                    next_state = B;
                else 
                    next_state = A;
            end

            B: begin
                if (w) 
                    next_state = C;
                else 
                    next_state = D;
            end

            C: begin
                if (w) 
                    next_state = E;
                else 
                    next_state = D;
            end

            D: begin
                if (w) 
                    next_state = F;
                else 
                    next_state = A;
            end

            E: begin
                if (w) 
                    next_state = E;
                else 
                    next_state = D;
            end

            F: begin
                if (w) 
                    next_state = C;
                else 
                    next_state = D;
            end

            default: next_state = A; // Safety net
        endcase
    end

    // State flip-flops
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) 
            current_state <= A;
        else 
            current_state <= next_state;
    end

    // Output logic for z
    always @* begin
        case (current_state)
            E: z = 1'b1;
            default: z = 1'b0;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: I've defined the states A, B, C, D, E, and F using a 3-bit enumerated type. This way, each state corresponds to a unique bit pattern.

2. **State Transition Logic**: A combinational `always @*` block determines the `next_state` based on the current state and the input `w`.

3. **State Flip-Flops**: The synchronous state update is handled in a separate `always` block that triggers on the rising edge of the clock or when the reset signal is high. When reset is asserted, the state resets to A.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `z` is assigned based on the current state. It is high only when the state is E.

This Verilog code should give you an FSM functionality as described in your requirements. You can simulate or synthesize this design based on your needs.
