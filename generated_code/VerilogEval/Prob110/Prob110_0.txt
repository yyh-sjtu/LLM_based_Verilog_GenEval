Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the specified `TopModule`, which is a Moore state machine with the required states, inputs, and outputs.

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input j,
    input k,
    output reg out
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        OFF = 2'b00,
        ON  = 2'b01
    } state_t;
    
    state_t current_state, next_state;
    
    // Sequential logic for state transition
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= OFF; // Reset to OFF state
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state; // Transition to next state
        end
    end

    // Combinatorial logic for next state and output logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            OFF: begin
                out = 1'b0; // Output is 0 in OFF state
                if (j == 1'b1) begin
                    next_state = ON; // Transition to ON state if j=1
                end else begin
                    next_state = OFF; // Stay in OFF state if j=0
                end
            end
            
            ON: begin
                out = 1'b1; // Output is 1 in ON state
                if (k == 1'b1) begin
                    next_state = OFF; // Transition to OFF state if k=1
                end else begin
                    next_state = ON; // Stay in ON state if k=0
                end
            end
            
            default: begin
                out = 1'b0; // Default output (should not be reached)
                next_state = OFF; // Default next state
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **State Definition**: The states of the machine are represented using an enumerated type `state_t`, where `OFF` and `ON` are defined.

2. **Sequential Logic**: The state transition occurs on the positive edge of the clock or during a reset. If the `areset` (asynchronous reset) signal is high, the state resets to `OFF`.

3. **Combinatorial Logic**: The `always @(*)` block defines the behavior of the state machine:
   - If in the `OFF` state and `j` is high (`1`), it transitions to the `ON` state; otherwise, it remains in `OFF`.
   - If in the `ON` state and `k` is high (`1`), it transitions to the `OFF` state; otherwise, it remains in `ON`.

4. **Output Logic**: The output `out` is determined by the current state: `0` when in `OFF` and `1` when in `ON`.

This code implements the specified Moore state machine behavior. You can simulate it using testbenches to validate its functionality.
