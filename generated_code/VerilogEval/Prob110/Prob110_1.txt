Here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing the Moore state machine as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input j,
    input k,
    output reg out
);

// Define states
parameter OFF = 0;
parameter ON = 1;

// Define state register
reg [1:0] state, next_state;

// Moore state machine logic
always @ (posedge clk or posedge areset)
begin
    if (areset)
        state <= OFF;
    else
        state <= next_state;
end

always @ (*)
begin
    case (state)
        OFF: begin
            if (j)
                next_state = ON;
            else
                next_state = OFF;
        end
        ON: begin
            if (k)
                next_state = OFF;
            else
                next_state = ON;
        end
        default: next_state = state;
    endcase
end

// Output logic
always @ (*)
begin
    case (state)
        OFF: out = 0;
        ON: out = 1;
        default: out = 0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This code implements the TopModule with clock, asynchronous reset, two inputs (j and k), and one output (out) following the Moore state machine described. The state transitions are based on the input signals j and k, and the output is determined by the current state. The module should toggle between the OFF and ON states based on the input conditions as specified.
