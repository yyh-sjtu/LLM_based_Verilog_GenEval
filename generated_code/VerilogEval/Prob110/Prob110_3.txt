Below is an example implementation of the TopModule in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input j,
    input k,
    output reg out
);

// State definition
localparam OFF = 2'b00;
localparam ON = 2'b01;

// State register
reg [1:0] state, next_state;

// Outputs
always @(*) begin
    case(state)
        OFF: begin
            if(j)
                next_state = ON;
            else
                next_state = OFF;
        end
        ON: begin
            if(k)
                next_state = OFF;
            else
                next_state = ON;
        end
    endcase
end

// State transition
always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if(areset)
        state <= OFF;
    else
        state <= next_state;
end

// Output logic
always @(*) begin
    case(state)
        OFF: out = 1'b0;
        ON: out = 1'b1;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines the TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs and implements the Moore state machine logic as described in the diagram. The state transitions are based on the values of inputs j and k, and the output out is set accordingly based on the current state. The module also includes an asynchronous active-high reset functionality to reset the state machine to the OFF state.
