As a professional RTL designer, I would approach the implementation of the TopModule as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input bump_left,
    input bump_right,
    input ground,
    output reg walk_left,
    output reg walk_right,
    output reg aaah
);

// State definition
typedef enum logic [1:0] {
    WALK_LEFT,
    WALK_RIGHT,
    FALLING
} State;

// State and output registers
reg [1:0] state, next_state;
reg next_walk_left, next_walk_right, next_aaah;

// State machine logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        state <= WALK_LEFT;
        walk_left <= 1;
        walk_right <= 0;
        aaah <= 0;
    end else begin
        state <= next_state;
        walk_left <= next_walk_left;
        walk_right <= next_walk_right;
        aaah <= next_aaah;
    end
end

// Next state logic
always @* begin
    next_state = state;
    next_walk_left = walk_left;
    next_walk_right = walk_right;
    next_aaah = aaah;

    case (state)
        WALK_LEFT: begin
            if (bump_right) begin
                next_state = WALK_RIGHT;
                next_walk_left = 0;
                next_walk_right = 1;
            end else if (!ground) begin
                next_state = FALLING;
                next_aaah = 1;
            end
        end

        WALK_RIGHT: begin
            if (bump_left) begin
                next_state = WALK_LEFT;
                next_walk_left = 1;
                next_walk_right = 0;
            end else if (!ground) begin
                next_state = FALLING;
                next_aaah = 1;
            end
        end

        FALLING: begin
            if (ground) begin
                next_state = (walk_left) ? WALK_LEFT : WALK_RIGHT;
                next_aaah = 0;
            end
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements the TopModule with a Moore state machine that models the behavior of the Lemming as described. The Lemming can walk left, walk right, and fall while saying "aaah" based on the inputs and the current state. The state transitions are determined by the inputs and the current state.

The use of an asynchronous reset ensures that the Lemming machine is initialized to walk left when the `areset` signal is asserted.

As a professional RTL designer, I would simulate and verify this code using a hardware description language simulator and perform thorough testing to ensure the correctness of the implementation. Additionally, I would consider optimizations and refinements based on timing constraints and design requirements.
