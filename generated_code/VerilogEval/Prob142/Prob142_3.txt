Sure, I can help you design the RTL for the `TopModule` based on the specifications you've provided. Here's an implementation of a Moore state machine in SystemVerilog. 

This module implements the behavior you described for the Lemmings game:

```systemverilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  areset,
    input  bump_left,
    input  bump_right,
    input  ground,
    output reg walk_left,
    output reg walk_right,
    output reg aaah
);

    // State Encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        STATE_WALK_LEFT = 2'b00,
        STATE_WALK_RIGHT = 2'b01,
        STATE_FALLING = 2'b10
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Sequential Logic: State Transition
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= STATE_WALK_LEFT;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Combinational Logic: State Transition Logic
    always_comb begin
        // Default assignments
        next_state = current_state; // Hold the current state by default
        walk_left = 0;
        walk_right = 0;
        aaah = 0;

        case (current_state)
            STATE_WALK_LEFT: begin
                walk_left = 1; // Walking left
                // Check for bumps
                if (bump_right) begin
                    next_state = STATE_WALK_RIGHT; // Bump on the right
                end else if (!ground) begin
                    next_state = STATE_FALLING; // Falling
                end
            end
            
            STATE_WALK_RIGHT: begin
                walk_right = 1; // Walking right
                // Check for bumps
                if (bump_left) begin
                    next_state = STATE_WALK_LEFT; // Bump on the left
                end else if (!ground) begin
                    next_state = STATE_FALLING; // Falling
                end
            end
            
            STATE_FALLING: begin
                aaah = 1; // Falling, saying "aaah!"
                if (ground) begin
                    // Resuming the previous walking direction
                    if (current_state == STATE_WALK_LEFT) begin
                        next_state = STATE_WALK_LEFT; // Resume walking left
                    end else if (current_state == STATE_WALK_RIGHT) begin
                        next_state = STATE_WALK_RIGHT; // Resume walking right
                    end
                end
            end
            
            default: begin
                next_state = STATE_WALK_LEFT; // Default case (shouldn't happen)
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: The states are encoded using an enumeration `state_t`, which represents the three states: walking left, walking right, and falling.

2. **State Transition**: The state transitions are handled in a positive-edge triggered sequential logic block. If `areset` is high, the state is reset to `STATE_WALK_LEFT`.

3. **Combinational Logic**: The next state is determined based on the current state and the inputs:
    - In `STATE_WALK_LEFT`, if `bump_right` is high, the state transitions to `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`. If the ground is lost (`ground` = 0), the state moves to `STATE_FALLING`.
    - In `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`, a bump on the left causes a transition to `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and a loss of ground transitions to `STATE_FALLING`.
    - In `STATE_FALLING`, the module sets `aaah` to indicate that the Lemming is falling. Once the ground reappears, it resumes walking in the direction it was previously facing.

4. **Outputs**: The outputs `walk_left`, `walk_right`, and `aaah` are set according to the current state.

This implementation ensures that the required behaviors are followed according to your specifications for the Lemmings game.
