Here's an RTL implementation of the `TopModule` according to your specifications in Verilog. This module incorporates a down-counter that loads a value when the `load` signal is high, decrements when `load` is low, and asserts the terminal count (`tc`) when the countdown reaches zero.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [9:0] data,
    output reg tc
);

    reg [9:0] counter; // Internal 10-bit counter

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the counter with the specified data when load is high
            counter <= data;
            tc <= 1'b0; // Reset terminal count when loading new value
        end else begin
            // Decrement the counter if load is low
            if (counter > 0) begin
                counter <= counter - 1;
            end
            // Assert tc signal if the counter reaches 0
            if (counter == 1) begin
                tc <= 1'b1; // Terminal count asserted when reaching 0
            end else begin
                tc <= 1'b0; // Terminal count not asserted otherwise
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - The module `TopModule` accepts inputs for `clk`, `load`, and `data`, and provides an output `tc`.

2. **Internal Register**:
   - A 10-bit register named `counter` is defined to hold the countdown value.

3. **Always Block**:
   - Triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, the block performs the following:
     - If `load` is high, it loads the `data` into `counter` and resets `tc` to 0.
     - If `load` is low, the counter decrements if it is greater than 0.
     - The terminal count signal `tc` is asserted when the counter is about to reach 0 (after decrementing).

4. **tc Output Logic**:
   - The output `tc` is set to 1 only when the counter is 1 just before the next decrement; otherwise, it is reset to 0.

### Additional Notes:
- The counter does not go negative due to the check `if (counter > 0)`, so it stops counting down once it reaches zero. 
- If a new value is loaded into the counter while it is counting down (when `load` is asserted), the countdown is reset appropriately. 
- Ensure that any simulation or testing environment initializes the `counter` and `tc` values adequately.
