To implement the `TopModule` as described in your prompt, I'll outline the Verilog code for the module, including the necessary features like the counter, loading mechanism, and terminal count indicator (`tc`).

Here's the Verilog RTL design:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [9:0] data,
    output reg tc
);

    reg [9:0] counter; // Internal 10-bit counter

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the counter with new data when 'load' is asserted
            counter <= data;
            tc <= 1'b0; // Reset terminal count since counting starts over
        end else if (counter > 0) begin
            // Decrement the counter when 'load' is not asserted
            counter <= counter - 1;
            tc <= 1'b0; // 'tc' is low while counting down
        end
        
        // Assert 'tc' when counter reaches 0
        if (counter == 0) begin
            tc <= 1'b1; // Terminal count asserted
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `clk`: The clock signal driving the synchronous logic.
   - `load`: A control signal that signals when to load the new counter value.
   - `data`: A 10-bit input representing the number of cycles to count down (only valid when `load` is high).
   - `tc`: A signal that indicates when the counter has reached 0.

2. **Register Declaration**:
   - `reg [9:0] counter;`: A 10-bit register that holds the countdown value.

3. **Always Block**:
   - The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
   - If `load` is high, the counter is loaded with the value of `data`, and the `tc` signal is reset to 0, indicating the counter is starting fresh.
   - If `load` is low and the counter is greater than 0, the counter decrements by 1, and the `tc` signal is kept low.
   - When the counter reaches 0, the `tc` signal is asserted high (indicating terminal count), meaning the timer has elapsed.

### Behavior:
- The timer begins counting down from the value specified in `data` whenever the `load` signal is high.
- The `tc` output accurately reflects the state of the counter, being asserted when the counter is zero and remaining so until a new value is loaded.

This design is a simple and effective way to implement a countdown timer using a 10-bit register with the specified behavior. You can further enhance the design depending on specific requirements, such as incorporating reset functionalities or integrating with other components.
