As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule in Verilog as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [9:0] data,
    output reg tc
);

reg [9:0] counter;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        counter <= data;
    end else begin
        if (counter > 0) begin
            counter <= counter - 1;
        end
    end
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (counter == 0) begin
        tc <= 1'b1;
    end else begin
        tc <= 1'b0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code describes the behavior of the TopModule as specified, with the internal counter decrementing by 1 on each clock cycle when load is 0, and tc being asserted when the counter reaches 0. The code also includes a D flip-flop to synchronize the output signal tc with the clock.
