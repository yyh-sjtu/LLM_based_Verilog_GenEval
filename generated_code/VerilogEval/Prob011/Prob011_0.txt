Here is an RTL code implementation of the TopModule module that implements a NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    output out
);

assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with input ports a and b, and an output port out. The assign statement assigns the NOR operation result of input ports a and b to the output port out.
