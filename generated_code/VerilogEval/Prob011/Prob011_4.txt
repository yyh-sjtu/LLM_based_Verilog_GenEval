Sure, here is the Verilog code for the TopModule implementing a NOR gate:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a,
    input b,
    output out
);

assign out = ~(a | b);

endmodule
```

This module takes in two inputs, a and b, and outputs the result of a NOR operation on them, which is the logical negation of the OR operation between a and b.
