Sure! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule`, which implements a D flip-flop. The flip-flop captures the value of the input `d` on the positive edge of the clock and outputs it through `q`.

Here's the implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

    // On the positive edge of the clock, assign d to q
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        q <= d;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration:** `TopModule` is declared with `clk`, `d`, and `q` as its ports.
- **Input/Output Types:**
  - `clk` and `d` are defined as inputs.
  - `q` is defined as a register output (`output reg`), since it will hold the state of the flip-flop.
- **Always Block:** The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the assignment to `q` occurs on the rising edge of `clk`. The operator `<=` denotes a non-blocking assignment, which is typical for sequential logic.

With this configuration, when the clock signal transitions from low to high, the value of `d` will be captured and stored in `q`.
