To implement the `TopModule` in RTL (Register Transfer Level) for the given Karnaugh map, we'll define the module in Verilog. Based on the provided K-map, we can deduce the logic for the output `f` using the valid combinations of inputs.

### Karnaugh Map Analysis:
From the K-map:

```
                x[1]x[2]
  x[3]x[4]   00  01  11  10
        00 | d | 0 | d | d |
        01 | 0 | d | 1 | 0 |
        11 | 1 | 1 | d | d |
        10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d |
```

We see that:
- `f` is `1` for the minterms corresponding to:
  - `x = 11xx` (where x = [1, 1, 0, 0]), giving `1` when x[3]=1, x[4]=0 or 1.
  - `x = 10xx` (where x = [1, 0, 0, 0]), giving `1` when x[3]=1, x[4]=1.
- `f` is `1` for `x = 01 10` (1 xx)
- `f` is `0` for `x = 00 01` (0 xx)

### Simplified Logic:
From the analysis, we can derive the logical expression:
- `f = (x[3] & x[4]) | (x[1] & x[2])`

### Verilog Implementation:
Here is the Verilog code for `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [3:0] x, // 4-bit input
    output f       // 1-bit output
);

// Internal signal for output f
wire f;

// Implement the logical expression derived from K-map
assign f = (x[3] & x[4]) | (x[1] & x[2]);

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a 4-bit input `x` and a 1-bit output `f`.
- The output `f` is implemented using a combinational logic expression that uses bitwise AND and OR operations based on the K-map analysis.
- The `assign` statement drives the output `f` based on the derived expression.

You can synthesize this module with your RTL design tools to ensure it meets the logic requirements set by the K-map.
