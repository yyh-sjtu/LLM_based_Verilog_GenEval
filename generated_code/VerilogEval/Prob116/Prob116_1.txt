To implement the `TopModule` using SystemVerilog (or Verilog), we can derive the output logic function `f` from the provided Karnaugh map. The essential steps involve interpreting the map correctly and building a combinational logic circuit that matches the specified outputs.

Given the map values, let's extract the necessary minterms for when the output `f` is `1`:

- From the Karnaugh map, we see that `f` is `1` for the following combinations:
  - (x[3], x[4], x[1], x[2]) = (1, 1, 0, 0) => minterm 12
  - (x[3], x[4], x[1], x[2]) = (1, 1, 0, 1) => minterm 13
  - (x[3], x[4], x[1], x[2]) = (0, 1, 1, 0) => minterm 6
  - (x[3], x[4], x[1], x[2]) = (0, 1, 1, 1) => minterm 7

These correspond to the following binary representations for inputs `x[3]`, `x[4]`, `x[1]`, and `x[2]` (counting from 0):

- `x` = 1100 (binary) => output `f` = 1
- `x` = 1101 (binary) => output `f` = 1
- `x` = 0110 (binary) => output `f` = 1
- `x` = 0111 (binary) => output `f` = 1

In binary, these are:
- minterm 6: `(0, 1, 1, 0)` => 0110
- minterm 7: `(0, 1, 1, 1)` => 0111
- minterm 12: `(1, 1, 0, 0)` => 1100
- minterm 13: `(1, 1, 0, 1)` => 1101

Thus, we can express the function `f` in terms of the input bits:

Now, let's write the Verilog code for this logic:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [3:0] x, // 4-bit input
    output       f   // 1-bit output
);
    
    assign f = ( (x == 4'b0110) || // minterm for (0, 1, 1, 0)
                 (x == 4'b0111) || // minterm for (0, 1, 1, 1)
                 (x == 4'b1100) || // minterm for (1, 1, 0, 0)
                 (x == 4'b1101)    // minterm for (1, 1, 0, 1)
               );

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The `input [3:0] x` declaration specifies that `x` is a 4-bit input, which corresponds to x[3], x[2], x[1], and x[0].
- The output `f` is determined using a simple `assign` statement that checks for the conditions derived from the Karnaugh map directly, providing a logical '1' when any of the specified conditions are met. All don't-care conditions can be treated as either `0` or `1` based on convenience, but here it is represented simply as not affecting the encoding of true conditions for simplicity.
