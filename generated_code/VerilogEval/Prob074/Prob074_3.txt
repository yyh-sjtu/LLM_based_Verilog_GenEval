Here is the Verilog code implementation of the TopModule with the specified interface and behavior:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input x,
    output reg z
);

reg dff1, dff2, dff3;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    dff1 <= x ^ dff1;  // XOR gate
    dff2 <= ~(x & dff2);  // AND gate
    dff3 <= ~(x | dff3);  // OR gate

    z <= ~(dff1 & dff2 & dff3);  // XNOR gate
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements the required finite state machine behavior described in the problem statement. The input x is fed into three different two-input gates (XOR, AND, OR) before being input to the corresponding D flip-flops. The outputs of these flip-flops are then fed into a three-input XNOR gate to produce the output z. All sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

Please let me know if you need any further clarifications or modifications to the design.
