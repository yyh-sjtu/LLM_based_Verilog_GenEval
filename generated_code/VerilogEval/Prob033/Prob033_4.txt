Here is an example implementation of the TopModule in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] s,
    output reg overflow
);

always @ (*) begin
    s = a + b;
    
    if ((a[7] & b[7] & ~s[7]) | (~a[7] & ~b[7] & s[7])) begin
        overflow = 1;
    end else begin
        overflow = 0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, we use the always block to continuously compute the sum of the inputs a and b to produce the output s. We then check for overflow by considering the cases where the sign bits of a and b are different from the sign bit of the sum. If an overflow occurs, the overflow output is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.

This implementation assumes two's complement arithmetic for signed numbers.
