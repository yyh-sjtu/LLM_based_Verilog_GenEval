Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that meets your requirements. The module takes two 8-bit 2's complement numbers as inputs and produces their sum as output, along with an overflow indication.

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [7:0] a,     // 8-bit input a
    input  [7:0] b,     // 8-bit input b
    output [7:0] s,     // 8-bit output sum
    output overflow      // Overflow output
);
    
    wire signed [8:0] sum;   // 9-bit wire to capture the sum
    assign sum = {1'b0, a} + {1'b0, b}; // Extend a and b to 9 bits for addition

    assign s = sum[7:0]; // Lower 8 bits represent the sum
    assign overflow = (a[7] == b[7]) && (s[7] != a[7]); // Check for overflow condition

endmodule
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Module Declaration**: 
   - The module is named `TopModule` with the input and output ports as specified.

2. **Wire Declaration**: 
   - A 9-bit wire named `sum` is used to hold the result of adding the 8-bit numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It is declared as `signed` to properly track the sum of signed numbers.

3. **Addition**: 
   - The inputs `a` and `b` are extended to 9 bits using zero-padding (which means the MSB is `0` to avoid sign extension) before performing the addition. This ensures we account for any carry that might occur.

4. **Output Assignment**: 
   - `s` is assigned the lower 8 bits of the `sum`, which represents the actual 8-bit result of the addition.

5. **Overflow Logic**: 
   - The overflow is determined by checking two conditions:
     - If the MSBs (sign bits) of `a` and `b` are the same (both are positive or both negative).
     - If the MSB of the result, `s`, is different from the MSBs of `a` and `b`. This indicates that an overflow has occurred in the addition of signed numbers.

### Conclusion
This implementation covers the addition of two 8-bit signed numbers while correctly handling overflow conditions. You can integrate this module into your larger design as needed.
