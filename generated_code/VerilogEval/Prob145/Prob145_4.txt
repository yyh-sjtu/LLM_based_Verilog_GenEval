Below is the Verilog code for the TopModule module that implements the given sequential circuit based on the provided simulation waveforms:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clock,
    input a,
    output reg p,
    output reg q
);

reg state;

always @(posedge clock) begin
    if (state == 0 && a == 1) begin
        p <= 1;
        q <= 0;
        state <= 1;
    end else if (state == 1 && a == 1) begin
        p <= 1;
        q <= 0;
        state <= 1;
    end else if (state == 1 && a == 0) begin
        p <= 0;
        q <= 1;
        state <= 2;
    end else if (state == 2 && a == 0) begin
        p <= 0;
        q <= 1;
        state <= 2;
    end else begin
        p <= 0;
        q <= 0;
        state <= 0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the module TopModule implements the sequential circuit based on the given simulation waveforms. The state variable is used to keep track of the current state of the circuit. The output signals p and q are modified based on the state and input signal a when the clock signal is positive edge-triggered.

This code should reflect the behavior described in the simulation waveforms. Please let me know if you need any further clarification or adjustments.
