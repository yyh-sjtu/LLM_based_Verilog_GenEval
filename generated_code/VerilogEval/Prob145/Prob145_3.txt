Sure! Based on the given timing waveforms for the `TopModule`, we can analyze the behavior of the outputs, `p` and `q`, as they relate to the input `a` and the `clock` signal.

### Waveform Analysis:
1. For the first 25ns (0ns to 25ns), both `p` and `q` stay at `x` (unknown state). This suggests that itâ€™s not yet in a defined state.
2. Between `25ns` to `55ns`, `p` remains `0` and `q` remains `x`. This indicates that `q` is likely getting set based on the `clock` and `a`.
3. At `55ns`, we see a transition where `p` remains `0`, and `q` transitions to `0` as well.
4. At `70ns`, `a` transitions to `1`, and `p` gets set to `0`, and later transitions in `q` begin to follow structure based on certain conditions (notably at `90ns`, `q` becomes `0` when `a` is `1`).
5. `p` transitions between `0` and `1`, while `q` appears to respond to sequences of `a`.

### Circuit Behavior:
From the waveforms:
- `p` seems to act like a flip-flop that tracks the rising edge of `a`.
- `q` appears to toggle based on both the value of `a` and the previous state of `q`.

### RTL Implementation:
From the given behavior, we can implement the `TopModule` in SystemVerilog as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clock,
    input  wire a,
    output reg  p,
    output reg  q
);

    // State declarations can be added if needed,
    // but in this case, we operate sequentially
    always @(posedge clock) begin
        // p captures the value of a on the rising edge of clock
        p <= a; 

        // q behaves like a counter that reacts
        // to the state of a and p.
        if (a) begin
            if (p) begin
                q <= 1;  // Set q to 1 if p is 1
            end else begin
                q <= 0;  // Reset q if p is 0
            end
        end else begin
            // When a is 0, q maintains its state
            q <= q;  // Hold the current state of q
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Clock Sensitivity**: The `always @(posedge clock)` block ensures the operations occur on the rising edge of the clock signal.
2. **Output `p`**: Assigns the value of `a` at the positive edge of the clock, making `p` act to reflect `a`.
3. **Output `q`**: Responds to the combination of `a` and the current state of `p` to determine its output:
    - If `a` is `1` and `p` was set during the last clock cycle, `q` is set to `1`.
    - If `p` is `0`, `q` is reset to `0`.
    - When `a` is `0`, we hold the state of `q`.

### Note:
This is a starting point based on the provided waveforms. The exact logic might need tweaks based on additional requirements or edge cases not covered in the waveform. The behavior of `q` might imply a more complex operation depending on the rest of the circuit's requirements.
