Based on the provided simulation waveforms, it appears that the module should implement a simple D flip-flop. The output `p` follows the input `a` delayed by one clock cycle, while the output `q` follows `p` delayed by one clock cycle.

Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule implementing the D flip-flop:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clock,
    input a,
    output reg p,
    output reg q
);

reg p_next, q_next;

always @(posedge clock) begin
    p <= p_next;
    q <= q_next;
end

always @(posedge clock) begin
    p_next <= a;
    q_next <= p;
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module with input `clock` and `a`, and outputs `p` and `q`. Inside the module, two signals `p_next` and `q_next` are used to store the next values for `p` and `q`, respectively. On each positive clock edge, the values for `p` and `q` are updated.

Please let me know if you need any further clarification or modifications.
