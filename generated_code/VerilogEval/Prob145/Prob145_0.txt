To design the `TopModule` based on the provided waveform, we'll analyze the transition patterns of the outputs `p` and `q` based on the input signals `clock` and `a`. 

### Analysis of Given Waveforms

1. **Initialization and Steady States:**
   - At time 0ns to 25ns, `p` and `q` remain undefined (`x`) while both `clock` and `a` are 0.
   - At 25ns, `a` transitions to 1, and `p` remains 0 while `q` continues as `x`. 

2. **Reset Phase:**
   - After the 25ns point, `p` is 0 continuously for several clock cycles as it does not change until `clock` goes low at 55ns.
   - The output `q` remains 0 during this period.
   
3. **First High State of `a`:** 
   - At 70ns, when `a` transitions to 1 while `clock` is low, `q` changes to 1 but `p` remains at 0.
    
4. **Key Transitions:**
   - At 90ns, when `a` is 1 and the clock is high, `p` transitions to 1 while `q` remains 0.
   - At 95ns, when `clock` goes low, both outputs `p` and `q` return to 0.
   - Then, `q` starts alternating between 1 and 0, depending on inputs `a` and clock conditions.

5. **Final Behavior:**
   - `p` will change regularly depending on `clock` edges: it seems to act as a flip-flop based on the transitions.
   - `q` appears to follow a more complex state based on both `clock` and `a`.

### RTL Implementation

Following the analysis, a possible state machine is inferred, and we find a design using flip-flops or a more straightforward synchronous design. Hereâ€™s a Verilog module reflecting the behavior:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clock,
    input  wire a,
    output reg  p,
    output reg  q
);

    always @(posedge clock) begin
        // Process the inputs on clock rising edge
        if (a) begin
            p <= 1; // when a is high and clock goes high
        end else begin
            p <= 0; // when a is low, p resets
        end
    end

    always @(negedge clock) begin
        // Process the inputs on clock falling edge
        if (a) begin
            q <= ~q; // toggle q when a is high
        end else begin
            q <= 0; // when a is low, reset q
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Clock Edge Handling:** The design consists of two always blocks. One triggers on the positive edge of the clock to handle `p` and the other on the negative edge to handle `q`.
- **Output Logic:**
  - `p` becomes high immediately when `a` is high at a clock edge.
  - `q` toggles its state when `a` is high during a falling clock edge and resets to 0 when `a` is low.

This design captures the key behaviors as shown in the original waveforms while maintaining simplicity aligned with the inferred state machine characteristics. Further verification through simulation would be needed to ensure it meets all edge cases in the intended waveform patterns.
