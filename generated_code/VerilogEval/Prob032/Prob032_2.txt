As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule according to the given requirements. Here is the Verilog code for the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input     [2:0] vec,
    output reg [2:0] outv,
    output reg       o2,
    output reg       o1,
    output reg       o0
);

assign o0 = vec[0];
assign o1 = vec[1];
assign o2 = vec[2];

always @* begin
    outv = vec;
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the input `vec` is a 3-bit vector, and the output `outv` also consists of 3 bits. The module splits the input vector into three separate 1-bit outputs `o0`, `o1`, and `o2`, which are connected to the positions 0, 1, and 2 of the input vector respectively. The output `outv` is simply assigned the value of the input vector `vec`. This design ensures that the module functions as per the provided interface requirements.
