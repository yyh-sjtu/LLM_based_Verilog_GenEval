Sure! Below is a simple Verilog description of the `TopModule` that meets your specified requirements. The module takes a 3-bit input vector and outputs the same vector as a 3-bit output. Additionally, it splits the input vector into three separate 1-bit outputs.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire [2:0] vec,   // 3-bit input vector
    output wire [2:0] outv,  // 3-bit output vector
    output wire o2,          // Output for vec[2]
    output wire o1,          // Output for vec[1]
    output wire o0           // Output for vec[0]
);

    // Assign the 3-bit output directly from the input vector
    assign outv = vec;

    // Split the 3-bit input vector into individual 1-bit outputs
    assign o0 = vec[0]; // LSB
    assign o1 = vec[1];
    assign o2 = vec[2]; // MSB

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input and Output Declaration:**
   - The input `vec` is declared as a 3-bit wide wire.
   - The output `outv` is also declared as a 3-bit wide wire.
   - The outputs `o2`, `o1`, and `o0` are declared as individual 1-bit wide wires corresponding to the individual bits of the input vector.

2. **Output Assignments:**
   - `assign outv = vec;` directly connects the output vector to the input vector, producing the same 3-bit output.
   - The individual outputs `o0`, `o1`, and `o2` are assigned the corresponding bits of the input vector. Here, `o0` gets the least significant bit (LSB), `o1` gets the middle bit, and `o2` gets the most significant bit (MSB).

This module can be synthesized in hardware and should function as intended based on your specifications. If you have any more requirements or modifications, feel free to ask!
