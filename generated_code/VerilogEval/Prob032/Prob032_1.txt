Here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [2:0] vec,
    output [2:0] outv,
    output o2,
    output o1,
    output o0
);

assign outv = vec;
assign o2 = vec[2];
assign o1 = vec[1];
assign o0 = vec[0];

endmodule
```

This module takes a 3-bit input vector, passes it through as the output vector, and also separates it into three individual 1-bit outputs as specified. The output o0 corresponds to the least significant bit of the input vector, o1 to the middle bit, and o2 to the most significant bit.
