The original module does not handle the output signals (`shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving`) properly because it doesn't cover all possible conditions, and there are no default values assigned to the registered outputs. Without default assignments, these outputs can hold indeterminate states, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the module to ensure that both output signals are always assigned values, even if the specific conditions are not met. Hereâ€™s a fixed version of the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    // Initializing the outputs to default values
    initial begin
        shut_off_computer = 0;
        keep_driving = 0;
    end

    always @(*) begin
        // Logic for shut_off_computer
        if (cpu_overheated) 
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        else 
            shut_off_computer = 0; // Ensure it gets reset when not overheated
    end

    always @(*) begin
        // Logic for keep_driving
        if (~arrived) 
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty; // Continue driving if not arrived and gas tank is not empty
        else 
            keep_driving = 0; // If arrived, ensure keep_driving is reset
    end

endmodule
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Default Initialization**:
   - Added an `initial` block to set `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` to `0` when the module starts. This helps to avoid any undefined behavior.

2. **Reset Output Signals**:
   - Explicitly set `shut_off_computer` to `0` when `cpu_overheated` is not asserted.
   - Explicitly set `keep_driving` to `0` when `arrived` is `true`.

These changes ensure that both outputs always have defined values based on the input conditions while also addressing the logic intended in the original design.
