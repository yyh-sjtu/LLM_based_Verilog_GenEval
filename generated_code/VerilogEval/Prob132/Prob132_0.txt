The provided RTL code has a couple of issues, primarily related to the way the `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` signals are handled. 

1. The `shut_off_computer` signal should be set to 0 by default when `cpu_overheated` is not asserted. If it's not explicitly set to 0, it may retain its previous value (which is dangerous and can lead to unpredictable behavior).

2. The `keep_driving` signal should also be reset to a known state (0 or 1) when the input conditions change.

Here's a corrected version of the module addressing these issues:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Reset shut_off_computer if the CPU is not overheated
        if (cpu_overheated) begin
            shut_off_computer = 1;
        end else begin
            shut_off_computer = 0;  // Ensure it is set to 0 when not overheating
        end
    end

    always @(*) begin
        // Reset keep_driving to a known state
        if (~arrived) begin
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty;  // Driving if gas tank is not empty
        end else begin
            keep_driving = 0;  // Ensure it is set to 0 when arrived
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Initialization Logic**: The default states for `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` are set whenever the corresponding conditions are not met. This prevents any unintentional latching of the output signals.

2. **Explicit State Handling**: The outputs are explicitly reset to prevent undefined behaviors. This clarifies intention and ensures stability in the moduleâ€™s response. 

By ensuring that outputs are always defined under both conditions being true and false, the circuit behaves predictably according to the input signals.
