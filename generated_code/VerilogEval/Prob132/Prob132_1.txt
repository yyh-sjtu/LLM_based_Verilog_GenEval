Sure! The current implementation of the `TopModule` has a potential issue with the `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving` outputs, mainly because their values aren't defined in all paths, which can lead to unintended latches being inferred in synthesis. For every branch in both `always` blocks, we should ensure that all outputs have a defined state.

Here’s the corrected version of the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input      cpu_overheated,
    output reg shut_off_computer,
    input      arrived,
    input      gas_tank_empty,
    output reg keep_driving
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignment to avoid latch inference
        shut_off_computer = 0; // Default value 
      
        if (cpu_overheated)
            shut_off_computer = 1; // Set to 1 only if cpu_overheated is true   
    end

    always @(*) begin
        // Default assignment to avoid latch inference
        keep_driving = 1; // Default value 

        if (~arrived)
            keep_driving = ~gas_tank_empty; // Set keep_driving based on gas_tank_empty only if not arrived
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Default Assignments**: For both `shut_off_computer` and `keep_driving`, I provided a default assignment. This ensures that both signals have a defined value in all cases, preventing unwanted latches from being inferred.
   
2. **Clarified Logic**: The logic within each `always` block remains unchanged, but with the default assignments, there’s clearer behavior defined in case the conditions are not met.

3. **Clarity in Code**: The code is structured for clear understanding and maintenance while retaining the intended functionality. 

This approach effectively resolves the issues while preserving the original intended signal behaviors.
