The provided module has a bug in the way the `result_is_zero` flag is being determined. Specifically, the `result_is_zero` flag should be set based on the `out` being equal to zero, but the flag is not updated correctly in the `always` block. Additionally, the current implementation doesn't account for the case when subtraction may overflow, as well as the need to assign a value to `result_is_zero` for the case where `do_sub` is `1`.

Here's a corrected version of the adder-subtractor module:

```verilog
synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module TopModule (
    input do_sub,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out,
    output reg result_is_zero
);

  always @(*) begin
      // Perform the addition or subtraction based on the value of do_sub
      if (do_sub) begin
          out = a - b;
      end else begin
          out = a + b;
      end

      // Determine if the result is zero
      if (out == 8'b0) begin
          result_is_zero = 1'b1;
      end else begin
          result_is_zero = 1'b0;
      end
  end

endmodule
```

### Key Updates:
1. **Simplified Conditional Logic**: The use of an `if` statement instead of a `case` statement for readability. It checks if `do_sub` is high or low to perform the appropriate operation.
  
2. **Zero Flag Calculation**: The check for the zero flag is correctly evaluating if `out` is equal to zero, using `out == 8'b0`, which is a clearer and more explicit comparison.

3. **Ensuring Complete Control Logic**: The `result_is_zero` is properly updated for both paths, ensuring it reflects the current state of the `out` result.

This corrected version provides a robust and clear implementation for the adder-subtractor module, ensuring it behaves as expected in all scenarios.
