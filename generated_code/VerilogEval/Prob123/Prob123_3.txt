The bug in your original module is related to the way the `result_is_zero` flag is being determined. The assignment of `result_is_zero` is performed within the same always block and is not using a proper blocking assignment. Additionally, `result_is_zero` needs to be explicitly declared and assigned in all execution paths. 

Since `result_is_zero` should be re-evaluated each time the `out` value is updated, the code should ideally use a default state to ensure that `result_is_zero` does not retain a previous value when `out` changes.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the module:

```verilog
synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module TopModule (
    input do_sub,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [7:0] out,
    output reg result_is_zero
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Perform the addition or subtraction based on the control signal
        case (do_sub)
            1'b0: out = a + b;  // Addition
            1'b1: out = a - b;  // Subtraction
            default: out = 8'b0; // Safeguard against any unintended cases
        endcase

        // Evaluate the zero flag
        if (out == 8'b0)
            result_is_zero = 1'b1; // Set zero flag if out is zero
        else
            result_is_zero = 1'b0;  // Clear zero flag otherwise
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Zero Flag Assignment**: The zero flag is explicitly set to `1'b1` if the `out` is zero, otherwise it is set to `1'b0`.
2. **Default Case**: A default case is included to assign a value to `out` in case of unexpected values for `do_sub`. It ensures that `out` has a defined value at all times.
3. **Clarity and Maintenance**: The revised approach makes it clear how the zero flag is derived from the output. It adheres to coding best practices, improving readability and maintainability.
