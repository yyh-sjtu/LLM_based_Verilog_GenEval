Sure, I can help you with that! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` described in your request. This module uses a 32-bit shift register to keep track of the branch history for the predictions and mispredictions.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire areset,
    input  wire predict_valid,
    input  wire predict_taken,
    input  wire train_mispredicted,
    input  wire train_taken,
    input  wire [31:0] train_history,
    output reg  [31:0] predict_history
);

    // Shift register representing the 32 bits of history
    reg [31:0] history_reg;

    // Asynchronous reset and update logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            // On reset, clear the history register
            history_reg <= 32'b0;
        end else begin
            if (train_mispredicted) begin
                // If a misprediction occurs, load the history register
                history_reg <= {train_taken, train_history[31:1]}; 
            end else if (predict_valid) begin
                // Shift in the new prediction
                history_reg <= {predict_taken, history_reg[31:1]};
            end
            // Note: if neither prediction nor misprediction occurs,
            // the history_reg retains its current state.
        end
    end

    // Continuous assignment to output
    always @(*) begin
        predict_history = history_reg;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input and Output Ports**: The module takes in various inputs and outputs the 32-bit `predict_history`.
  
2. **Shift Register**: 
   - A 32-bit register called `history_reg` is declared to hold the history state.
   - The most recent branch direction is tracked in the least significant bit (LSB) of this register.
  
3. **Reset Logic**:
   - The `areset` input is handled asynchronously. When it is high, the `history_reg` is set to zero.

4. **Branch Prediction Logic**:
   - If `train_mispredicted` is high, the module updates the history register with new data. The new data is formed by concatenating `train_taken` (the actual direction of the branch) with the previous history (except for the oldest bit).
   - If `predict_valid` is high, and if it's not a misprediction, the history is updated by shifting in `predict_taken`. 

5. **Output Assignment**:
   - The output `predict_history` is continuously assigned the value of `history_reg`.

This implementation respects the requirements you've specified and operates correctly under the given conditions.
