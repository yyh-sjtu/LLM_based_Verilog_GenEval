As a professional RTL designer, I would start by creating a Verilog module named TopModule with the specified input and output ports. I would then implement the functionality described in the requirements.

Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input predict_valid,
    input predict_taken,
    input train_mispredicted,
    input train_taken,
    input [31:0] train_history,
    output reg [31:0] predict_history
);

reg [31:0] branch_history_reg;

always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        branch_history_reg <= 32'b0;
    end else begin
        if (train_mispredicted) begin
            branch_history_reg <= {train_history, train_taken};
        end else if (predict_valid) begin
            branch_history_reg <= {branch_history_reg[30:0], predict_taken};
        end
    end
end

assign predict_history = branch_history_reg;

endmodule
```

In this code, I have created a shift register `branch_history_reg` to store the 32-bit global history. The logic inside the always block updates the history register based on the input signals predict_valid, predict_taken, train_mispredicted, train_taken, and train_history. The predict_history output ports the value of the branch history register.

This implementation ensures that the branch history register is updated correctly based on predictions and mispredictions, with support for rolling back state in response to a pipeline flush caused by a misprediction. The asynchronous reset areset is also implemented to reset the history counter to zero.

I would then simulate and verify the functionality of the TopModule using a testbench to ensure that it behaves as expected according to the requirements.
