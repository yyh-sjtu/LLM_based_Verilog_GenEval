Here is the RTL design for the TopModule implementing a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input x,
    output reg z
);

// State definition
localparam IDLE = 2'b00;
localparam COMPLEMENT = 2'b01;

reg [1:0] state, next_state;

always @ (posedge clk or posedge areset)
begin
    if (areset)
        state <= IDLE;
    else
        state <= next_state;
end

always @ *
begin
    next_state = state;

    case (state)
        IDLE:
        begin
            if (!areset)
            begin
                if (x)
                    next_state = COMPLEMENT;
            end
        end

        COMPLEMENT:
        begin
            if (!areset)
                next_state = COMPLEMENT;
        end
    endcase
end

always @ (posedge clk)
begin
    case (state)
        IDLE:
        begin
            z <= 1'b0;
        end

        COMPLEMENT:
        begin
            z <= ~x;
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This RTL design implements the required TopModule with the specified interface for a one-input one-output serial 2's complementer Moore state machine. The module takes a series of input bits (x) and produces the 2's complement of the input as the output (z). The state machine transitions between IDLE and COMPLEMENT state based on the input and areset signal. The logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
