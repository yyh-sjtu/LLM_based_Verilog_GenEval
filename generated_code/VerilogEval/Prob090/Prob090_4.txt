Based on the provided simulation waveforms, we can analyze the behavior of the output `q` in response to the inputs `a` and `b` at different times. 

From the waveforms, we can infer the following:

- When `a` and `b` are both `0`, the output `q` is `0`.
- When `a` is `0` and `b` is `1`, the output `q` is `0` after a change of `b` to `1` (from 25ns to 30ns).
- When `a` is `1` and `b` is `0`, the output `q` is `0` after a change of `a` to `1` (from 35ns to 40ns).
- When `a` is `1` and `b` is `1`, the output `q` is `1`, and remains `1` when both inputs are `1` (from 45ns to 50ns).

From this, we can conclude that the condition for `q` to be `1` is when both `a` and `b` are `1`. 

We can encapsulate this behavior in a Boolean function (truth table or an expression) which leads us to the simple logical expression:
\[ q = a \land b \]

### Verilog RTL Implementation

Here is a simple RTL implementation of the `TopModule` based on our conclusion:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire q
);

// Combinational logic for the output
assign q = a & b;  // Logical AND operation

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- We declared the `TopModule` with inputs `a` and `b`, and output `q`.
- The `assign` statement implements the logical AND operation, which directly corresponds to the behavior we derived from the simulation observations. When both `a` and `b` are `1`, `q` will be `1`. For any other combinations, `q` will be `0`. 

This module adheres to the combinational logic design principles and effectively captures the required functionality.
