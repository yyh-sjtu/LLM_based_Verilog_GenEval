Here is the Verilog code implementation for the TopModule based on the provided simulation waveforms:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    output reg q
);

always @* begin
    case ({a, b})
        2'b00: q = 1'b0;
        2'b01: q = 1'b0;
        2'b10: q = 1'b0;
        2'b11: q = 1'b1;
        default: q = 1'b0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This code implements a combinational circuit based on the provided simulation waveforms. The circuit takes input signals `a` and `b`, and based on their values, produces the output signal `q`. The output `q` is determined by the input combination using a case statement.

Please review the code and let me know if you have any further requirements or modifications needed.
