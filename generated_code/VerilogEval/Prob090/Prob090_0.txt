To implement the desired combinational circuit in a module named `TopModule`, we first need to analyze the given waveform data. We are provided with input values `a` and `b` and their corresponding output value `q` over time.

### Table Analysis:
Let's summarize the relationship between inputs and outputs based on the provided data:

| Time | a | b | q |
|------|---|---|---|
| 0ns  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 5ns  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 10ns | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 15ns | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 20ns | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 25ns | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 30ns | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 35ns | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 40ns | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 45ns | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 50ns | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 55ns | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 60ns | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 65ns | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 70ns | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 75ns | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 80ns | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 85ns | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 90ns | 1 | 1 | 1 |

### Observations:
1. When both inputs `a` and `b` are `0`, the output `q` is `0`.
2. When `a` is `0` and `b` is `1`, `q` is still `0`.
3. When `a` is `1` and `b` is `0`, `q` is again `0`.
4. When both inputs are `1`, `q` becomes `1`.

From this analysis, we can conclude that the output `q` is `1` only when both `a` and `b` are `1`. This is the truth table for the logical AND operation:

- \( q = a \land b \)

### RTL Implementation:
Now we can write the RTL code in Verilog for `TopModule`.

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire q
);

    // Implementing a combinational circuit that outputs q = a AND b
    assign q = a & b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Module Declaration**: We declare a module named `TopModule` with the required input and output ports.
2. **Output Assignment**: The output `q` is assigned the result of the bitwise AND operation between inputs `a` and `b`. The use of the `assign` statement indicates that `q` is continuously driven by the expression `a & b`, making this a combinational circuit.

This completes the implementation based on the provided simulation waveforms. Feel free to let me know if you need further assistance or simulations!
