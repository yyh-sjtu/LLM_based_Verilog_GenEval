Certainly! Below is an example of a Verilog implementation for the `TopModule` as described in your request. This module will control the heating and cooling system based on the mode and temperature input signals.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  mode,        // Thermostat mode: 1 for heating, 0 for cooling
    input  too_cold,    // Signal indicating it's too cold
    input  too_hot,     // Signal indicating it's too hot
    input  fan_on,      // User request for fan to be on
    output reg heater,   // Heater control output
    output reg aircon,   // Air conditioner control output
    output reg fan       // Fan control output
);

always @(*) begin
    // Default outputs
    heater = 0;
    aircon = 0;
    fan = 0;

    // Control logic for the thermostat
    if (fan_on) begin
        // If requested by the user, turn on the fan
        fan = 1;
    end else begin
        // Control based on mode
        if (mode) begin
            // Heating mode
            if (too_cold) begin
                heater = 1;   // Turn on the heater
                fan = 1;      // Turn on the fan
            end
        end else begin
            // Cooling mode
            if (too_hot) begin
                aircon = 1;   // Turn on the air conditioner
                fan = 1;      // Turn on the fan
            end
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The module has four inputs: `mode`, `too_cold`, `too_hot`, and `fan_on`.
   - There are three output control signals: `heater`, `aircon`, and `fan`.

2. **Control Logic**:
   - The outputs are defaulted to `0` at the start of every evaluation in the `always` block.
   - If the user requests the fan to be on (`fan_on`), the fan is activated regardless of the other conditions.
   - In heating mode (`mode = 1`), if it’s too cold (`too_cold = 1`), the heater is turned on and the fan is also turned on.
   - In cooling mode (`mode = 0`), if it’s too hot (`too_hot = 1`), the air conditioner is activated, and similarly, the fan is turned on.

### Usage:
This module can be instantiated in another design to control the heater, air conditioning, and fan based on the specified conditions. It implements a simple state-based decision-making process for climate control in a home or building.
