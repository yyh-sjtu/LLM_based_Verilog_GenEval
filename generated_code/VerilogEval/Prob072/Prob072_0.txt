Here is a simple implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that satisfies the specifications you provided. This module controls the heater, air conditioner, and fan based on the different inputs.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire mode,        // 0 for cooling mode, 1 for heating mode
    input wire too_cold,   // 1 if it's too cold
    input wire too_hot,    // 1 if it's too hot
    input wire fan_on,     // 1 if user wants the fan on
    output reg heater,     // 1 to turn on the heater
    output reg aircon,     // 1 to turn on the air conditioner
    output reg fan         // 1 to turn on the fan
);

    always @(*) begin
        // Default outputs
        heater = 0;
        aircon = 0;
        fan = 0;

        // Manage fan request
        if (fan_on) begin
            fan = 1; // Turn on fan if requested by user
        end else if (mode) begin
            // Heating mode
            if (too_cold) begin
                heater = 1; // Turn on heater if it's too cold
                fan = 1;    // Turn on fan to circulate air
            end
        end else begin
            // Cooling mode
            if (too_hot) begin
                aircon = 1; // Turn on air conditioner if it's too hot
                fan = 1;    // Turn on fan to circulate air
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `mode`: Determines if the module is in heating mode (`mode = 1`) or cooling mode (`mode = 0`).
   - `too_cold`: Indicates if the temperature is below the threshold (1 if so).
   - `too_hot`: Indicates if the temperature is above the threshold (1 if so).
   - `fan_on`: A user command to turn the fan on regardless of the heating/cooling conditions.

2. **Outputs:**
   - `heater`: Turns on the heater when necessary.
   - `aircon`: Turns on the air conditioner when necessary.
   - `fan`: Activates the fan to circulate air when the heater or air conditioner is on, or if the user requests the fan.

3. **Behavior:**
   - The `fan` is turned on if the user requests it (`fan_on == 1`).
   - In heating mode, the heater is turned on if it is too cold, and the fan is activated to circulate the air.
   - In cooling mode, the air conditioner is turned on if it is too hot, with the fan also being activated.

This structure should effectively implement the desired thermostat functionality according to the provided specifications.
