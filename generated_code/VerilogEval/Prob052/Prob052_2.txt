As a professional RTL designer, I will implement the TopModule module as requested. Here is the Verilog code for the module:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [99:0] in,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor
);

assign out_and = &in;
assign out_or = |in;
assign out_xor = ^in;

endmodule
```

In this code, the module TopModule takes in a 100-bit input signal `in[99:0]` and implements three output signals `out_and`, `out_or`, and `out_xor` which represent the output of a 100-input AND gate, OR gate, and XOR gate respectively.

If you have any further requirements or need additional modules, please let me know. I am here to assist you in your RTL design needs.
