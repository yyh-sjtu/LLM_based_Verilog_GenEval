Sure, here is the implementation of the TopModule module in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [99:0] in,
  output out_and,
  output out_or,
  output out_xor
);

assign out_and = &in;
assign out_or = |in;
assign out_xor = ^in;

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the input port `in` is a 100-bit wide vector representing the 100 input bits. The `out_and` output is the result of a bitwise AND operation on all the input bits. The `out_or` output is the result of a bitwise OR operation on all the input bits. The `out_xor` output is the result of a bitwise XOR operation on all the input bits.

This module implements a combinational circuit that performs the AND, OR, and XOR operations on the 100 input bits and produces the corresponding outputs.
