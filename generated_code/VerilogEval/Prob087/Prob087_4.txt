Here's a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as per your specifications. The module has two one-bit input ports (`a` and `b`) and seven one-bit output ports for the respective logic operations.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    output wire out_and,
    output wire out_or,
    output wire out_xor,
    output wire out_nand,
    output wire out_nor,
    output wire out_xnor,
    output wire out_anotb
);

    // Implementing the logic gates
    assign out_and   = a & b;        // AND operation
    assign out_or    = a | b;        // OR operation
    assign out_xor   = a ^ b;        // XOR operation
    assign out_nand  = ~(a & b);     // NAND operation
    assign out_nor   = ~(a | b);     // NOR operation
    assign out_xnor  = ~(a ^ b);     // XNOR operation
    assign out_anotb = a & ~b;       // AND-NOT operation (a and not b)

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The module has two inputs `a` and `b`, both declared as `wire` types. 
   - It has seven outputs associated with each logic gate. 

2. **Logic Operations**:
   - Each logic operation is implemented using continuous assignments (`assign` statements).
   - The bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and AND-NOT operations are implemented directly using the respective Verilog operators.

3. **Synthesis**:
   - This Verilog code can be synthesized into a physical circuit using any standard synthesis tool.

You can instantiate this module within a testbench or another module to simulate and test its functionality.
