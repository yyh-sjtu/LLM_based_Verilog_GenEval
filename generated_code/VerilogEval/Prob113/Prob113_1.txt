To implement the TopModule module with the specified interface and function f, we can use the following Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [3:0] x,
    output f
);

assign f = (x[2] & x[3]) | (!x[2] & !x[3] & !x[0]) | (x[0] & x[1]) | (x[0] & !x[1] & !x[3]);

endmodule
```

This code defines the TopModule module with a 4-bit input x and a single output f. The output f is calculated based on the given Karnaugh map logic function.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or have any other requirements.
