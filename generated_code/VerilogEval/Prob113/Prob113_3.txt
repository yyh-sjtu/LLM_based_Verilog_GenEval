To implement the TopModule with the given functionality, we can use a combinational logic circuit using logical gates.

Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule implementing the function f based on the provided Karnaugh map:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] x,
    output f
);

assign f = !(x[2] & !x[3]) | (x[0] & !x[1]) | (x[0] & x[2] & !x[1]) | (x[1] & !x[2] & x[3]);

endmodule
```

In this code, we are using the input x to calculate the output f based on the conditions provided in the Karnaugh map. The logical operations used in the assign statement represent the conditions specified in the truth table.

Please let me know if you need any further clarification or assistance with this implementation.
