As a professional RTL designer, I would approach this problem by first analyzing the truth table provided in the Karnaugh map to determine the logic function that needs to be implemented. 

Based on the Karnaugh map, the output f is 1 for the following input combinations:
- When x[2:3] = 00 or 10
- When x[2:3] = 11 and x[0:1] = 01 or 10

I would implement this logic in Verilog code using if-else statements or a case statement to handle the different input combinations as specified in the Karnaugh map. 

Here is an example Verilog code for implementing the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] x,
    output reg f
);

always @* begin
    case(x[3:2])
        2'b00, 2'b10: f = 1;
        2'b11: begin
            case(x[1:0])
                2'b01, 2'b10: f = 1;
                default: f = 0;
            endcase
        end
        default: f = 0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements the desired logic function based on the input combinations specified in the Karnaugh map. This module can now be synthesized and integrated into a larger RTL design.
