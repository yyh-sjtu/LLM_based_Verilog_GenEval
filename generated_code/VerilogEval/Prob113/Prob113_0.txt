Sure! Let's implement the `TopModule` in Verilog based on the provided Karnaugh map. We will first determine the logical expression for the output `f` based on the K-map data and then write the RTL code for the module.

### Step 1: Interpretation of the K-map

The K-map you provided shows the following truth table for the bits `x[3:0]`:

```
             x[0]x[1]
x[2]x[3]  00  01  11  10
  00     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
  01     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  11     | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
  10     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
```

From the K-map, we can derive the following minterms:
- For `x[3:0] = 0000` → 1 (Minterm: 0)
- For `x[3:0] = 0010` → 1 (Minterm: 2)
- For `x[3:0] = 1100` → 1 (Minterm: 12)
- For `x[3:0] = 1101` → 1 (Minterm: 13)
- For `x[3:0] = 1110` → 1 (Minterm: 14)
- For `x[3:0] = 1010` → 1 (Minterm: 10)

### Step 2: Simplification

Now let's group and simplify the minterms based on the K-map:

1. Group (first two rows at `x[2] = 0`): {0000, 0010} → Covers: `x[2]'x[3]'`
2. Group (two ones vertically at `x[3]=0 and x[2]=1`): {1100, 1101, 1110} → Covers: `x[3]'x[2]`
3. Group (on the left column of `x[2] = 1`) coverage of {1010} which is part of the previous grouping since it shares with previous logic.

Resulting simplified expression:
\[ f = x[2]'x[3]' + x[2]x[1]' + x[2]x[0] \]

This gives us an overall expression for `f`.

### Step 3: Verilog Code

Here’s the RTL implementation of the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire [3:0] x,  // 4-bit input
    output wire        f   // 1-bit output
);

    // Logic implementation based on the minimized expression
    assign f = (~x[2] & ~x[3]) | (x[2] & ~x[1]) | (x[2] & x[0]); // f = x2'x3' + x2x1' + x2x0

endmodule
```

### Summary

The provided Verilog code implements the `TopModule` according to the specifications from the K-map. The logic equations derived from the K-map were translated directly into the logic expressions using bitwise operators. You can test this module with a testbench to verify its functionality.
