Certainly! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that fulfills the given specifications. The module compares two 2-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, and sets the output `z` to 1 if they are equal; otherwise, it sets `z` to 0.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [1:0] A,  // 2-bit input A
    input [1:0] B,  // 2-bit input B
    output z        // output z
);

    // Compare the two 2-bit inputs and assign the result to output z
    assign z = (A == B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The module `TopModule` is defined with two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B` and one output `z`.
- The output `z` is determined by comparing `A` and `B` using the equality operator (`==`).
- The ternary operator is used to assign the value to `z` based on the comparison:
  - If `A` equals `B`, `z` is set to `1'b1`.
  - If `A` does not equal `B`, `z` is set to `1'b0`.
