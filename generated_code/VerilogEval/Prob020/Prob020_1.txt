Certainly! Here's a simple implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that compares two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B` and produces a single bit output `z` indicating whether the two inputs are equal.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [1:0] A, // 2-bit input A
    input  [1:0] B, // 2-bit input B
    output       z   // output z
);

    // Compare the two 2-bit inputs and assign the result to the output z
    assign z = (A == B) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Module Declaration**: The module is defined as `TopModule` with two 2-bit inputs `A` and `B`, and one output `z`.
  
- **Input and Output Ports**: 
  - `input [1:0] A`: This denotes that `A` is a 2-bit input.
  - `input [1:0] B`: This denotes that `B` is a 2-bit input.
  - `output z`: This is a single-bit output.

- **Output Logic**: The output `z` is assigned using a conditional statement. It checks if `A` is equal to `B`:
  - If `A` equals `B`, `z` is set to `1` (true).
  - If `A` does not equal `B`, `z` is set to `0` (false).

### Note:
- The equality check `A == B` is directly synthesizable, which means that synthesis tools will generate efficient hardware for this comparison.
  
This module can now be instantiated in larger designs or tested with a testbench to verify its functionality. If you need a testbench or any additional modifications, feel free to ask!
