Here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing the circuit as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [1:0] A,
    input [1:0] B,
    output reg z
);

always @(*) begin
    if (A == B) begin
        z = 1;
    end
    else begin
        z = 0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module TopModule with two 2-bit inputs A and B, and an output z. Inside the module, there is a combinational logic that checks if A is equal to B, and assigns the value of 1 to z if they are equal, otherwise assigns 0 to z.
