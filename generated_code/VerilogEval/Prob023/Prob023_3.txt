Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that takes a 100-bit input and reverses the bit ordering, producing a 100-bit output.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [99:0] in,   // 100-bit input
    output [99:0] out   // 100-bit output
);

    // Intermediate wire for output
    wire [99:0] reversed_bits;

    // Generate statements to reverse the bits
    generate
        genvar i;
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1) begin : reverse_bits
            assign reversed_bits[i] = in[99 - i];
        end
    endgenerate

    // Assign the reversed bits to output
    assign out = reversed_bits;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The `TopModule` is defined with input `in` and output `out`, both of size 100 bits.
2. **Generate Statement**: A generate loop is used to iterate through the range from 0 to 99. For each `i`, the `i`-th bit of the `out` signal is assigned the value of the `(99 - i)`-th bit of the `in` signal. This effectively reverses the order of the bits.
3. **Output Assignment**: Finally, the `out` signal is directly assigned to `reversed_bits`, though this is not strictly necessary, as the output could also be directly assigned within the generate block.

With this implementation, when you provide a 100-bit input, the module will produce the corresponding reversed 100-bit output.
