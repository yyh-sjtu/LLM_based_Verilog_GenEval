Certainly! Below is an example of a Verilog implementation for the `TopModule` that reverses the byte order of a 32-bit input vector.

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [31:0] in,  // 32-bit input
    output [31:0] out  // 32-bit output
);

    // Reversing the byte order
    assign out = {in[7:0], in[15:8], in[23:16], in[31:24]};

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The `in` input is a 32-bit vector which is divided into four bytes:
  - `in[7:0]` is the least significant byte (LSB)
  - `in[15:8]` is the second byte
  - `in[23:16]` is the third byte
  - `in[31:24]` is the most significant byte (MSB)

- The output `out` is constructed by assembling these bytes in reverse order:
  - The LSB (`in[7:0]`) becomes the most significant byte of `out`.
  - The second byte (`in[15:8]`) becomes the next most significant byte of `out`.
  - The third byte (`in[23:16]`) follows.
  - The MSB (`in[31:24]`) becomes the least significant byte of `out`.

### Simulation and Synthesis:
You can synthesize this module using any standard synthesizer, and it should work seamlessly when instantiated in a larger design or simulation environment.
