Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements the specified combinational circuit with a 4-bit input and the outputs for AND, OR, and XOR operations.

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input  [3:0] in,   // 4-bit input
    output out_and,    // Output of 4-input AND gate
    output out_or,     // Output of 4-input OR gate
    output out_xor     // Output of 4-input XOR gate
);

// Implementing the 4-input AND gate
assign out_and = in[0] & in[1] & in[2] & in[3];

// Implementing the 4-input OR gate
assign out_or = in[0] | in[1] | in[2] | in[3];

// Implementing the 4-input XOR gate
assign out_xor = in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Declaration**: The `in` input is defined as a 4-bit wide vector, which allows for 16 different combinations of binary inputs.
2. **Output Declarations**: The outputs are defined as 1-bit wide, according to the requested specifications.
3. **AND Operation**:
   - The `out_and` output is calculated using the bitwise AND operation on all four bits of the `in` signal.
4. **OR Operation**:
   - The `out_or` output is determined using the bitwise OR operation on the same four bits.
5. **XOR Operation**:
   - The `out_xor` output is computed using the bitwise XOR operation, which accumulates the effect across all four bits.

This module functions as intended, providing the outputs based on the specified logical operations for the 4-bit input.
