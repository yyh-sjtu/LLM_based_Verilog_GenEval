To implement the `TopModule` based on the observed simulation waveforms, we can analyze the behavior of the output `q` with respect to inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

### Analyzing the Truth Table

From the waveform data provided:

| time | a | b | c | d | q |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0    | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 20   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 25   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 30   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 35   | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 40   | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 45   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 50   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 55   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 60   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 65   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 70   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 75   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 80   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 85   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 90   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

### Observations
- `q = 0` for `(a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 0, 0)`, `(0, 0, 0, 1)`, and `(1, 0, 0, 0)`, `(1, 0, 0, 1)`.
- `q = 1` in all other cases.

### Simplifying the Logic
1. `q = 0` when:
   - `a = 0`, `b = 0` and `c = 0`
   - `a = 1` and `b = 0`
   
2. Based on this analysis:
   - The output `q` can be expressed as:
     
     ```
     q = !(a & !b) & !(b & !c & !d)
     ```

Now we can implement this logic in Verilog.

### Verilog Code
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire q
);

    assign q = (a & b & c) | (a & b & d) | (a & c & d) | 
               (b & c & d) | (!a & b & c) | (!a & b & d) | 
               (!a & c & d) | (!b & c & d) | 
               (!a & !b & d) | (!a & !b & c);

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Implementation
- The `assign` statement in Verilog is used to define the combinational logic for `q`.
- The logic uses bitwise and logical operations to generate the output based on the input combinations that have been observed.
- This implementation should now produce the expected behavior as seen in the simulation waveform data.

Ensure to run simulations with this module to verify that it accurately reproduces the observed waveforms.
