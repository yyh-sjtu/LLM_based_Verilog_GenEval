Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule based on the provided simulation waveforms:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output q
);

assign q = (a & b) | (c & d);

endmodule
```

This code implements a combinational circuit that computes the output q based on the input signals a, b, c, and d as per the given simulation waveforms. In this circuit, q is calculated as the OR operation between the AND of inputs a and b, and the AND of inputs c and d.
