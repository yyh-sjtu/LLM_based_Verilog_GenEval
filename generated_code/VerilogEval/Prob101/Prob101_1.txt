Based on the provided simulation waveforms, we can analyze the output `q` in relation to the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The output `q` is asserted (set to high) under the following conditions:

1. (a=0, b=0, c=0, d=1) → q = 0
2. (a=0, b=0, c=1, d=0) → q = 1
3. (a=0, b=0, c=1, d=1) → q = 1
4. (a=0, b=1, c=0, d=0) → q = 1
5. (a=0, b=1, c=0, d=1) → q = 1
6. (a=0, b=1, c=1, d=0) → q = 1
7. (a=0, b=1, c=1, d=1) → q = 1
8. (a=1, b=0, c=0, d=0) → q = 0
9. (a=1, b=0, c=0, d=1) → q = 0
10. (a=1, b=0, c=1, d=0) → q = 1
11. (a=1, b=0, c=1, d=1) → q = 1
12. (a=1, b=1, c=0, d=0) → q = 1
13. (a=1, b=1, c=0, d=1) → q = 1
14. (a=1, b=1, c=1, d=0) → q = 1
15. (a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1) → q = 1

From this analysis, we can summarize the conditions under which `q` is equal to 1:

- q = 1 when:
  - a = 0 and (c = 1 or b = 1)
  - a = 1 and (c = 1 or b = 1)

In Verilog RTL, we can implement the logic as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire c,
    input  wire d,
    output wire q
);

// Combinational logic
assign q = (~a & (b | c)) | (a & (b | c));

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The output `q` is computed based on the logic derived from the conditions above.
- The `assign` statement implements the derived logic directly using combinational logic expressions.
- The circuit effectively outputs a high signal when the conditions summarized are met.
