Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that acts as a 256-to-1 multiplexer based on the specified requirements:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [1023:0] in,  // 1024 bits input
    input  [7:0]   sel,  // 8 bits select signal
    output [3:0]   out   // 4 bits output
);

    // Calculate the starting index of the selected 4-bit segment
    // Each selection corresponds to 4 bits, so we need to multiply sel by 4.
    wire [9:0] index = sel * 4;

    // Use the calculated index to select the output from the input vector
    assign out = in[index +: 4];  // Select 4 bits starting from calculated index

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - **`in`**: A 1024-bit input vector which encompasses 256 4-bit segments.
   - **`sel`**: An 8-bit input used to select one of the 256 groups of 4 bits.
   - **`out`**: A 4-bit output representing the selected group of bits.

2. **Index Calculation**:
   - The multiplexer selects which 4-bit segment to output based on the value of `sel`. As each selection corresponds to 4 bits, the starting index for the selected group can be calculated as `sel * 4`.

3. **Bit Slicing**:
   - The expression `in[index +: 4]` in Verilog is used to select 4 bits starting from the calculated `index`. This constructs the output based on the selected range.

This implementation efficiently implements a 256-to-1 multiplexer, ensuring simplicity while adhering to the stated functional specifications.
