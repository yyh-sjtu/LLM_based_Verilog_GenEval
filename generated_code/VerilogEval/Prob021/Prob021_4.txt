Certainly! Below is a SystemVerilog implementation of the `TopModule` that behaves as a 4-bit wide, 256-to-1 multiplexer based on your specifications.

### TopModule Code

```systemverilog
module TopModule (
    input  logic [1023:0] in,    // 1024-bit input
    input  logic [7:0]   sel,    // 8-bit select input
    output logic [3:0]   out     // 4-bit output
);

    // Calculate the starting index of the selected 4-bit input
    logic [9:0] index; // 8-bit sel + 2 bits for 4-bit word width
    assign index = sel << 2; // Multiply sel by 4 to get the correct index in the 1024 bits

    // Assign the output based on the selected portion of the input
    assign out = in[index +: 4];  // Grab 4 bits starting from index

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **Input and Output Specifications:**
   - `in` is a 1024-bit input vector.
   - `sel` is an 8-bit select vector.
   - `out` is a 4-bit output.

2. **Index Calculation:**
   - The output is based on the `sel` input, which selects one of the 256 possible 4-bit inputs. Since each input spans 4 bits, the index for the `in` vector is calculated by left-shifting the `sel` value by 2 (i.e., `sel << 2`). This effectively multiplies the `sel` value by 4.

3. **Bit Slicing:**
   - The `+:` operator in `in[index +: 4]` is used to extract 4 bits starting from the calculated index. This provides the desired 4-bit output based on the selected portion of the input vector.

### Simulation / Synthesis Considerations
- Ensure synthesis tools support SystemVerilog. If you are required to use Verilog, you can modify the syntax accordingly.
- Confirm the correctness of the module through simulation, especially with various `sel` input values to validate the corresponding outputs.

Feel free to adapt the code to fit into your specific environment or simulation framework!
