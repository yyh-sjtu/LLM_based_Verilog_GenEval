Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` which behaves as specified. It implements a two-bit saturating counter that increments and decrements based on the `train_valid` and `train_taken` signals. It also handles an asynchronous reset which initializes the counter to `2'b01`.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire areset,
    input wire train_valid,
    input wire train_taken,
    output reg [1:0] state
);

// State declaration
initial begin
    state = 2'b01; // Initialize to weakly not-taken
end

always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        state <= 2'b01; // Reset the counter to weakly not-taken
    end else if (train_valid) begin
        if (train_taken) begin
            // Increment state, saturate at 3
            if (state < 2'b11) begin
                state <= state + 1;
            end
        end else begin
            // Decrement state, saturate at 0
            if (state > 2'b00) begin
                state <= state - 1;
            end
        end
    end
    // Otherwise, state remains unchanged
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**: 
   - `clk`: The clock signal.
   - `areset`: Asynchronous reset.
   - `train_valid`: Control signal for valid training.
   - `train_taken`: Indicates whether the training should increment or decrement the counter.
   - `state`: A 2-bit output representing the current counter value.

2. **Initial State**: 
   - The counter is initialized to `2'b01`, which represents a weakly not-taken state.

3. **Always Block**:
   - The block triggers on the positive edge of the clock or on the positive edge of `areset`.
   - If `areset` is high, the state is reset to `2'b01`.
   - If `train_valid` is asserted, then the counter either increments or decrements based on the value of `train_taken`:
     - If `train_taken` is high, the counter increments but saturates at `3` (i.e., `2'b11`).
     - If `train_taken` is low, the counter decrements but does not go below `0` (i.e., `2'b00`).

4. **Saturation Logic**: 
   - The increments and decrements are controlled using comparisons to ensure that the counter remains within the range `[0, 3]`.

5. **State Holding**: 
   - If `train_valid` is `0`, the counter retains its value, as required.

This design meets the specifications you provided for the saturating counter behavior.
