Here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing the two-bit saturating counter:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input train_valid,
    input train_taken,
    output reg [1:0] state
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        state <= 2'b01; // Reset to weakly not-taken
    end else begin
        if (train_valid) begin
            if (train_taken && (state < 3)) begin
                state <= state + 1; // Increment counter (up to 3)
            end else if (!train_taken && (state > 0)) begin
                state <= state - 1; // Decrement counter (down to 0)
            end
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This RTL code defines the TopModule with the specified inputs and outputs. The module implements the two-bit saturating counter logic as described, where the counter value is updated based on the inputs train_valid and train_taken. The counter is reset to 2'b01 on the positive edge of the areset signal. The state output represents the two-bit counter value. The sequential logic inside the always block is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
