Here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing the two-bit saturating counter as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input train_valid,
    input train_taken,
    output reg [1:0] state
);

always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        state <= 2'b01; // Reset to weakly not-taken
    end else begin
        if (train_valid) begin
            if (train_taken && (state < 2'b11)) begin
                state <= state + 1; // Increment counter
            end else if (!train_taken && (state > 2'b00)) begin
                state <= state - 1; // Decrement counter
            end
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with the specified input and output ports. Inside the module, there is a sequential always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock and the positive edge of the asynchronous reset signal areset. The counter logic is based on the train_valid and train_taken signals to determine whether to increment, decrement, or keep the counter at its current value. The counter value is stored in the output register state.
