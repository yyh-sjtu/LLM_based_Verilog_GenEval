Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of a module named `TopModule`. This module implements a 100-bit left/right rotator based on the specified interface and functionality.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  load,
    input  [1:0] ena,
    input  [99:0] data,
    output reg [99:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the data into the rotator
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            case (ena)
                2'b01: begin
                    // Rotate right by one bit
                    q <= {q[0], q[99:1]};
                end
                2'b10: begin
                    // Rotate left by one bit
                    q <= {q[98:0], q[99]};
                end
                2'b00, 2'b11: begin
                    // Do not rotate
                    q <= q; // This line is not strictly necessary, but it makes the case explicit
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - `clk`: Clock signal used for synchronous operation.
   - `load`: When high, the module loads the data input into the `q` register.
   - `ena`: 2-bit enable signal that determines the direction and type of operation (rotate left, rotate right, or no operation).
   - `data`: 100-bit input data to load into the rotator.
   - `q`: 100-bit output representing the contents of the rotator.

2. **Clock Behavior:**
   - The module operates on the positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`).

3. **Loading Data:**
   - When `load` is high, the contents of `data` are loaded into the register `q`.

4. **Rotating Logic:**
   - Using a case statement on `ena`, the module can rotate the contents of `q`:
     - `2'b01`: Rotates right by one bit. The least significant bit (bit 0) wraps around to the most significant bit (bit 99).
     - `2'b10`: Rotates left by one bit. The most significant bit (bit 99) wraps around to the least significant bit (bit 0).
     - `2'b00` and `2'b11`: No rotation occurs; `q` retains its previous value.

### Simulation and Testing:
You should write a testbench to verify the functionality of the `TopModule`, simulating various scenarios such as loading data and performing rotations based on the `ena` signal.
