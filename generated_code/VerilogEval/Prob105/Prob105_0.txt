Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation for the `TopModule` as specified. This module will act as a 100-bit left/right rotator with synchronous loading capabilities.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input       clk,
    input       load,
    input [1:0] ena,
    input [99:0] data,
    output reg [99:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load data into the register
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            case (ena)
                2'b01: begin
                    // Rotate right by 1 bit
                    q <= {q[0], q[99:1]}; // Shift right and wrap around the bit
                end
                2'b10: begin
                    // Rotate left by 1 bit
                    q <= {q[98:0], q[99]}; // Shift left and wrap around the bit
                end
                default: begin
                    // 2'b00: Do not rotate
                    // 2'b11: Do not rotate
                    q <= q; // Retain current value
                end
            endcase
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `clk`: The clock signal used for synchronous behavior.
   - `load`: When high, the `data` input is loaded into the rotator.
   - `ena`: This 2-bit signal determines the rotation direction.
   - `data`: The 100-bit input used for loading into the rotator.
   - `q`: The current state of the rotator output.

2. **Behavior**:
   - The `always` block is triggered on the rising edge of `clk`.
   - If `load` is high, the module loads the `data` input into `q`.
   - Otherwise, based on the value of `ena`:
       - For `2'b01`, the contents of `q` are rotated right by 1 bit.
       - For `2'b10`, the contents of `q` are rotated left by 1 bit.
       - For `2'b00` and `2'b11`, no rotation occurs, and the value of `q` remains unchanged.

3. **Rotation Logic**:
   - The right rotation is performed by placing the least significant bit (LSB) at the most significant position (MSB).
   - The left rotation is performed by placing the most significant bit (MSB) at the least significant position (LSB).

This module meets the requirements provided for a 100-bit left/right rotator with synchronous loading and enable functionality.
