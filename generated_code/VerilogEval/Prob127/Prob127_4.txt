Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation of the `TopModule`, which describes a simple finite state machine (FSM) for the Lemmings game, as you've requested.

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  areset,
    input  bump_left,
    input  bump_right,
    output reg walk_left,
    output reg walk_right
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        STATE_WALK_LEFT = 2'b00,
        STATE_WALK_RIGHT = 2'b01
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State Transition - (in the always block that is sensitive to clock)
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= STATE_WALK_LEFT; // Reset to walk left state
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state; // Transition to the next state
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic for state transition and output
    always @(*) begin
        // Default Outputs
        walk_left = 0;
        walk_right = 0;

        // Next state logic
        case (current_state)
            STATE_WALK_LEFT: begin
                walk_left = 1; // Current State - Walking Left

                if (bump_right || bump_left) begin
                    next_state = STATE_WALK_RIGHT; // Bumped on the left or right
                end else begin
                    next_state = STATE_WALK_LEFT; // Stay in the same state
                end
            end

            STATE_WALK_RIGHT: begin
                walk_right = 1; // Current State - Walking Right
                
                if (bump_left || bump_right) begin
                    next_state = STATE_WALK_LEFT; // Bumped on the left or right
                end else begin
                    next_state = STATE_WALK_RIGHT; // Stay in the same state
                end
            end
            
            default: begin
                // Default case should not occur if the FSM is designed correctly.
                next_state = STATE_WALK_LEFT; // Safe fallback
                walk_left = 1;
                walk_right = 0;
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation
1. **State Encoding**: The Lemming can be in one of two states: `STATE_WALK_LEFT` and `STATE_WALK_RIGHT`. Encoding them as 2-bit states helps with clarity.

2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The `areset` input is used to asynchronously reset the FSM to the left walking state. This reset uses the `posedge` trigger to ensure synchronous behavior while allowing immediate reaction to the reset signal.

3. **State Transition Logic**: When the clock signal transitions high, the current state is updated based on the next state logic defined in the combinational always block.

4. **Output Logic**: The outputs `walk_left` and `walk_right` are set depending on the current state. If the Lemming is walking left, `walk_left` is set to 1. If bumping occurs (either left or right), the state transitions accordingly to the opposite direction.

5. **Default Fallback**: A default case in the state machine ensures that we have a safe fallback state, which can be helpful in simulations or unforeseen scenarios.
