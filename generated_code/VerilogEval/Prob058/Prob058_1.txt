Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule implementing an XOR gate using three different methods:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    input b,
    output out_assign,
    output out_always_comb,
    output reg out_always_ff
);

// Using assign statement
assign out_assign = a ^ b;

// Using combinational always block
always @* begin
    out_always_comb = a ^ b;
end

// Using clocked always block
always @(posedge clk) begin
    out_always_ff <= a ^ b;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the XOR gate is implemented using assign statement, a combinational always block, and a clocked always block as specified in the interface. The output from the assign statement is directly assigned to `out_assign`, the output from the combinational always block is assigned to `out_always_comb`, and the output from the clocked always block is registered and delayed by one clock cycle in `out_always_ff`.
