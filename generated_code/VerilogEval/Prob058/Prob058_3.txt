Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements the specified interface and functionality, specifically creating an XOR gate in three different ways.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  a,
    input  b,
    output out_assign,
    output out_always_comb,
    output reg out_always_ff
);

// Assign statement for XOR operation
assign out_assign = a ^ b;

// Combinational always block for XOR operation
always @(*) begin
    out_always_comb = a ^ b;
end

// Clocked always block for XOR operation with flip-flop
always @(posedge clk) begin
    out_always_ff <= a ^ b;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Ports**:
   - `clk`: This is the clock signal for triggering the flip-flop.
   - `a` and `b`: These are the input signals to the XOR operation.

2. **Output Ports**:
   - `out_assign`: The output from the assign statement, which directly computes `a ^ b`.
   - `out_always_comb`: The output from the combinational always block, also computing `a ^ b`.
   - `out_always_ff`: The output from the clocked always block, which computes `a ^ b` on the positive edge of the clock and stores it in a flip-flop, thus creating a delay.

### Important Notes:
- The `out_always_ff` is declared as `reg` because it is driven by a clocked always block.
- The other two outputs utilize continuous assignment and combinational logic, which do not require a `reg` type.
