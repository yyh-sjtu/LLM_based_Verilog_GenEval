Sure! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, showcasing the requested functionality. The module uses three different methods to perform the XOR operation: 

1. An `assign` statement for continuous assignment (`out_assign`)
2. A combinational `always` block (`out_always_comb`)
3. A clocked `always` block for sequential logic (`out_always_ff`)

Here's how the implementation looks:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,            // Clock input
    input  wire a,              // Input a
    input  wire b,              // Input b
    output wire out_assign,     // Output from assign statement
    output reg  out_always_comb, // Output from combinational always block
    output reg  out_always_ff   // Output from clocked always block (flip-flop)
);

    // Continuous assignment: simple XOR using assign statement
    assign out_assign = a ^ b;

    // Combinational always block
    always @* begin
        out_always_comb = a ^ b; // Compute XOR
    end

    // Sequential always block (flip-flop)
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out_always_ff <= a ^ b; // Compute XOR on clock edge
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **`out_assign`**: The output is assigned directly using the `assign` statement which reflects the result of the XOR operation between `a` and `b` continuously.

2. **`out_always_comb`**: This output uses a combinational `always` block that triggers whenever there is a change in `a` or `b`. The result of `a ^ b` is computed and assigned to `out_always_comb`.

3. **`out_always_ff`**: This output uses a clocked `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of `clk`. It computes the XOR of `a` and `b` and stores the result in a flip-flop, hence introducing a one clock cycle delay.

### Simulation Considerations:
- Ensure that `clk`, `a`, and `b` are driven appropriately in a testbench to simulate the behavior of the module.
- Given the nature of flip-flops used in `out_always_ff`, it will exhibit a timing delay corresponding to the clock period. As a result, you will see the changes in `out_always_ff` occurring one clock cycle after the changes in `a` and `b`.
