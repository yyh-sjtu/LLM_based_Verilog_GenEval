Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as per your specifications. The module takes six 5-bit inputs, concatenates them, and then splits them into four 8-bit outputs. Additionally, two 1 bits, which are set to '1', are appended to the least significant bits.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [4:0] a,
    input [4:0] b,
    input [4:0] c,
    input [4:0] d,
    input [4:0] e,
    input [4:0] f,
    output reg [7:0] w,
    output reg [7:0] x,
    output reg [7:0] y,
    output reg [7:0] z
);

    // Intermediate wire for the concatenated input
    wire [29:0] concatenated_inputs;

    // Concatenate the inputs and add two '1' bits at the end
    assign concatenated_inputs = {a, b, c, d, e, f};

    // Assign the outputs from the concatenated input
    always @* begin
        w = {concatenated_inputs[29:22], 2'b11}; // First 8 bits + two '1's
        x = {concatenated_inputs[21:14], 2'b11}; // Next 8 bits + two '1's
        y = {concatenated_inputs[13:6], 2'b11};  // Next 8 bits + two '1's
        z = {concatenated_inputs[5:0], 2'b11};    // Last 8 bits + two '1's
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Concatenation**: The `concatenated_inputs` wire concatenates all six 5-bit input vectors together.
2. **Output Assignment**: The `always @*` block is used to assign the 8-bit outputs (`w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`). 
   - Each output is assigned from the concatenated input, adjusting the bit ranges to fill the 8 bits.
   - The last two bits of each output vector are set to `1` as specified.
  
### Note:
- The numbers in square brackets will ensure that we are pulling the correct bits out of the concatenated input for each output.
- The outputs `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` include two '1' bits appended to fulfill the requirement. 

You can simulate this module in an RTL simulator to verify its functionality!
