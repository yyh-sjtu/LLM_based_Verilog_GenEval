Sure, here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing the required functionality:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [4:0] a,
    input [4:0] b,
    input [4:0] c,
    input [4:0] d,
    input [4:0] e,
    input [4:0] f,
    output reg [7:0] w,
    output reg [7:0] x,
    output reg [7:0] y,
    output reg [7:0] z
);

always @ (*) begin
    {z, y, x, w} <= {a, b, c, d, e, f, 2'b11};
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the input vectors a, b, c, d, e, and f are concatenated together in the order specified and the result is stored in output vectors w, x, y, and z with two LSB bits as '11'. This module follows the required interface as mentioned. Let me know if you have any further questions or need modifications.
