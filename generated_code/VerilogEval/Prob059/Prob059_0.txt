To implement the TopModule with the specified interface and behavior, you can use Verilog HDL. Below is an example of how you can define the module:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    output reg w,
    output reg x,
    output reg y,
    output reg z
);

assign w = a;
assign x = b;
assign y = b;
assign z = c;

endmodule
```

In this Verilog module, the input ports `a`, `b`, and `c` are directly connected to the output ports `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively. The `assign` statements are used to make these connections. The `reg` keyword is used to declare the output ports as registers to store the values.

You can further customize the module based on your specific requirements or add any additional functionality as needed.
