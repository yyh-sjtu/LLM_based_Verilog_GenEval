Sure! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog. This module takes 3 input ports (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and drives 4 output ports (`w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`) according to the specified connections.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    output wire w,
    output wire x,
    output wire y,
    output wire z
);

// Assigning inputs to outputs as per specification
assign w = a; // a -> w
assign x = b; // b -> x
assign y = b; // b -> y
assign z = c; // c -> z

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: We declare the `TopModule` with designated input and output ports.
- **Wire Assignment**: The `assign` statements make direct connections between the inputs and outputs according to your requirements.
  - `w` receives the value of `a`.
  - `x` and `y` both receive the value of `b`.
  - `z` receives the value of `c`.

This module essentially acts like a simple interconnecting wiring system based on the specified conditions. You can simulate and test this module with your desired testbench to verify its functionality.
