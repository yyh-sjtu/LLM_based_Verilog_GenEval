Here is the implementation of the TopModule module in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

reg [7:0] d_reg;

always @(negedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        d_reg <= 8'b00110100; // reset to 0x34
    end else begin
        d_reg <= d;
    end
end

always @(negedge clk) begin
    q <= d_reg;
end

endmodule
``` 

This module includes 8 D flip-flops with active high synchronous reset, where the flip-flops are reset to 0x34. The D flip-flops are triggered by the negative edge of the clock signal. The input D is stored in a register d_reg and is output as q.
