Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule module that implements 8 D flip-flops with active high synchronous reset:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

reg [7:0] q_reg;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q_reg <= 8'b00110100; // reset value 0x34
    end else begin
        q_reg <= d;
    end
end

assign q = q_reg;

endmodule
``` 

This Verilog code creates a module named TopModule with the specified interface. It includes 8 D flip-flops with active high synchronous reset, where the flip-flops are reset to 0x34 instead of zero. The D flip-flops are triggered by the negative edge of the clock signal, and the output q is asynchronously assigned with the value of the q_reg register.
