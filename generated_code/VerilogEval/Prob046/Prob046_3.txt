Here is the Verilog code implementation of the TopModule module as per the given requirements:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
    );

    reg [7:0] d_reg;

    always @ (negedge clk or posedge reset)
    begin
        if (reset)
            d_reg <= 8'b00110100; // Reset to 0x34
        else
            d_reg <= d;
    end

    always @ (negedge clk)
    begin
        q <= d_reg;
    end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, I have declared an 8-bit register `d_reg` to hold the value of input `d`. The values of `d_reg` are updated on the negative edge of the clock signal. When the `reset` signal is active high, the reset value 0x34 is loaded into `d_reg`. The value of `q` is updated with the contents of `d_reg`.

Please let me know if you need any further modifications or clarification.
