Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule implementing a full adder with the specified interface:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input cin,
    output reg cout,
    output reg sum
);

always @(*)
begin
    // Full adder logic
    sum = a ^ b ^ cin;
    cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin);
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with the specified input and output ports. Inside the module, there is an always block that calculates the sum and carry-out based on the inputs a, b, and cin using the logic of a full adder. The sum is calculated using XOR gates, and the carry-out is calculated using OR gates. 

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications to the code.
