Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of a module named `TopModule` that serves as a full adder, conforming to the specified interface.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,       // First input bit
    input wire b,       // Second input bit
    input wire cin,     // Carry-in bit
    output wire cout,   // Carry-out bit
    output wire sum     // Sum bit
);

    // Logic for sum and carry-out
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;          // Sum calculation: XOR of all inputs
    assign cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin); // Carry-out calculation

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Input Ports:**
  - `a`, `b`, and `cin` are the input bits.
  
- **Output Ports:**
  - `cout` is the carry-out.
  - `sum` is the result of the addition (sum).

### Logic:
1. The `sum` output is calculated using the XOR operator (`^`), which gives the result of adding the three input bits without considering the carry.
   - Formula: `sum = a XOR b XOR cin`

2. The `cout` output is calculated using the AND (`&`) and OR (`|`) operators, based on the conditions under which a carry would be generated in binary addition.
   - Formula: `cout = (a AND b) OR (b AND cin) OR (a AND cin)`

This implementation provides a complete solution for a 1-bit full adder. You can instantiate `TopModule` in a larger design or test it with testbenches to verify its functionality.
