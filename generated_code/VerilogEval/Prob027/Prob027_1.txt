Certainly! Below is an implementation of a simple full adder in Verilog, defined as the `TopModule`. This module takes three input bits—`a`, `b`, and `cin`—and produces an output sum and carry-out `cout`.

### Verilog Code for `TopModule`

```verilog
// Define the module TopModule with input and output ports
module TopModule (
    input wire a,        // first input bit
    input wire b,        // second input bit
    input wire cin,      // carry-in bit
    output wire cout,    // carry-out bit
    output wire sum      // sum output
);

    // Logic for the sum and cout
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;         // Sum is the XOR of the inputs
    assign cout = (a & b) | (cin & (a ^ b)); // Carry-out logic

endmodule
```

### Explanation
- **Inputs**:
  - `a`: First bit of the input
  - `b`: Second bit of the input
  - `cin`: Carry-in bit
- **Outputs**:
  - `cout`: Carry-out which indicates whether there's an overflow (1 if overflow occurs)
  - `sum`: The sum of the three bits

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The sum is calculated using the XOR operation. The expression `a ^ b ^ cin` effectively returns the sum of the bits without considering the carry-out.
2. The carry-out `cout` is determined by checking:
   - If both `a` and `b` are 1 (which produces a carry), or
   - If either `a` or `b` is 1 and `cin` is also 1 (which would also produce a carry).
   - This is expressed as `(a & b) | (cin & (a ^ b))`.

You can instantiate the `TopModule` in a testbench or another module as needed. If you have any questions about testing or extending this module, feel free to ask!
