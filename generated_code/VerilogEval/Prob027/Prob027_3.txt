Here is an implementation of a `TopModule` in Verilog that fulfills the requirements of a full adder. The module has three input ports (`a`, `b`, and `cin`) and two output ports (`cout` and `sum`).

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,     // First input bit
    input  wire b,     // Second input bit
    input  wire cin,   // Carry-in bit
    output wire cout,  // Carry-out bit
    output wire sum    // Sum bit
);

    // Full adder logic
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;        // Sum is the XOR of a, b, and cin
    assign cout = (a & b) | (cin & (a ^ b)); // Carry-out logic

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:

1. **Input and Output Ports**:
   - The module has three input ports `a`, `b`, and `cin`, all declared as `input wire`.
   - The output ports `cout` and `sum` are declared as `output wire`.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The sum is calculated using the XOR operation: `sum = a ^ b ^ cin`. This means the sum will be `1` if there is an odd number of `1`s among the inputs.
   - The carry-out (`cout`) is calculated with the expression: `cout = (a & b) | (cin & (a ^ b))`. This checks if both `a` and `b` are `1` or if one of them is `1` and there is a carry-in.

### Usage:
You can instantiate this module in a testbench or another module as necessary, keeping in mind to connect the input and output signals correctly.
