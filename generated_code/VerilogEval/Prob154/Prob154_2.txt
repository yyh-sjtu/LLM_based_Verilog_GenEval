Let's implement the `TopModule` with an FSM (Finite State Machine) to detect message boundaries based on the provided specifications. The module will include a sequential logic block for state transitions and a combinational logic block for output assignments.

Hereâ€™s a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that meets the required functionality:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [23:0] out_bytes,
    output reg done
);

    // State Declaration
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        IDLE,
        COLLECT_BYTE1,
        COLLECT_BYTE2,
        COLLECT_BYTE3
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State Transition
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next State Logic
    always @(*) begin
        done = 0; // Default done is low
        next_state = current_state; // Default to hold the state

        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in[3]) begin // Check if current byte indicates start of new message
                    next_state = COLLECT_BYTE1;
                end
            end
            
            COLLECT_BYTE1: begin
                out_bytes[23:16] = in; // Store first byte
                next_state = COLLECT_BYTE2;
            end
            
            COLLECT_BYTE2: begin
                out_bytes[15:8] = in; // Store second byte
                next_state = COLLECT_BYTE3;
            end
            
            COLLECT_BYTE3: begin
                out_bytes[7:0] = in; // Store third byte
                done = 1; // Signal that message is done at next clock edge
                next_state = IDLE; // Go back to IDLE state
            end
            
            default: begin
                next_state = IDLE; // Fallback to IDLE for other states
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Module

1. **State Declaration**:
   - We define an enumeration type `state_t` for our FSM states: `IDLE`, `COLLECT_BYTE1`, `COLLECT_BYTE2`, and `COLLECT_BYTE3`.

2. **State Transition Logic**:
   - We use a synchronous reset; when the `reset` signal is high, it will reset the `current_state` to `IDLE`.
   - On each clock cycle, based on the current state and the value of `in`, we determine the next state.

3. **Combinational Logic for Next State**:
   - In the `IDLE` state, if the condition `in[3]` is true (indicating a potential start of a new message), we transition to `COLLECT_BYTE1`.
   - In `COLLECT_BYTE1`, we store the incoming byte in the upper 8 bits of `out_bytes` and transition to `COLLECT_BYTE2`.
   - In `COLLECT_BYTE2`, we store the second byte and transition to `COLLECT_BYTE3`.
   - In `COLLECT_BYTE3`, we store the third byte and assert `done`, indicating that the full message has been received. After that, we transition back to `IDLE`.

4. **Output Assignment**:
   - The outputs `out_bytes` and `done` are assigned within the state logic, ensuring that `out_bytes` holds valid data when `done` is asserted.

### Notes
- The signal `done` will be high for one clock cycle (specifically right after the third byte is received).
- The `out_bytes` is assigned valid values only when `done` is asserted, else it can be set to don't-care values. 
- Always ensure that during simulation, the reset condition is properly handled for an initial burst of incoming data. 

This implementation operates under the assumption that the incoming byte stream is continuous and determined by external logic that isn't included here.
