Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that fulfills the specified requirements. This module uses a finite-state machine (FSM) to detect the sequence `1101` in a continuous stream of input bits. When the sequence is detected, it sets the output `start_shifting` to `1` until reset is asserted.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input data,
    output reg start_shifting
);

    // State definitions for the FSM
    typedef enum reg [2:0] {
        S0,  // Initial state
        S1,  // Received '1'
        S2,  // Received '11'
        S3,  // Received '110'
        S4   // Received '1101'
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State transition logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (current_state)
            S0: begin
                next_state = (data) ? S1 : S0;
            end
            S1: begin
                next_state = (data) ? S2 : S0;
            end
            S2: begin
                next_state = (data) ? S2 : S3;
            end
            S3: begin
                next_state = (data) ? S4 : S0;
            end
            S4: begin
                next_state = S4; // Remain in S4 when the sequence is found
            end
            default: next_state = S0; // Default state
        endcase
    end

    // State update on clock edge, and reset handling
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= S0;
            start_shifting <= 0; // Reset start_shifting to 0
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
            start_shifting <= (current_state == S4) ? 1 : start_shifting; // Set to 1 when in S4
        end
    end

    // Reset start_shifting when the FSM is reset
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            start_shifting <= 0;
        end 
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Definitions**: The FSM has five states:
    - **S0**: Initial state where no bit has been matched.
    - **S1**: The first `1` has been detected.
    - **S2**: The second `1` has been detected (`11`).
    - **S3**: `110` has been matched.
    - **S4**: The complete sequence `1101` has been matched.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The `always @(*)` block defines how the FSM transitions between different states based on the input `data`.

3. **Sequential Logic**: The primary `always @(posedge clk)` block handles state updates on the clock cycle and implements synchronous reset functionality. It also manages the `start_shifting` output depending on the current state.

4. **Reset Logic**: On a positive edge of the `clk`, if `reset` is high, the FSM resets to the initial state `S0` and sets `start_shifting` to `0`.

### Notes:
- The `start_shifting` signal will only be set to `1` when the FSM reaches the `S4` state, indicating that the sequence `1101` was detected.
- The `start_shifting` will remain `1` until the reset signal is active.
- The code assumes that all inputs and outputs are declared and managed properly in a larger FPGA or ASIC design environment.
