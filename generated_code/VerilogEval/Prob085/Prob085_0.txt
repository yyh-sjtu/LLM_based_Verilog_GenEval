Certainly! Below is an RTL implementation of the `TopModule` as per your specifications. This Verilog module implements a 4-bit right shift register with the required features including asynchronous reset, synchronous load, and enable functionalities.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input areset,
    input load,
    input ena,
    input [3:0] data,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

// Asynchronous reset
always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
    if (areset) begin
        // Reset the shift register
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        // Check load and ena conditions
        if (load) begin
            // Load new data into the shift register
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            // Shift right
            q <= {1'b0, q[3:1]}; // Shift right and zero-fill the leftmost bit
        end
        // If neither load nor ena are asserted, q remains unchanged
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
1. **Asynchronous Reset**: The reset input `areset` is checked at the sensitivity list for `posedge clk` or `posedge areset`. If the reset signal is high, the shift register `q` is immediately set to zero.

2. **Clock Triggered Logic**:
    - On the positive edge of the clock, if `load` is asserted, the data input `data` is loaded into the shift register `q`.
    - If `load` is not asserted and `ena` is asserted, the shift register shifts to the right. The most significant bit (q[3]) is filled with 0, and the least significant bit (q[0]) is discarded.

3. **Preserving State**: If neither `load` nor `ena` are asserted, the previous state of `q` remains intact.

With this design, you will have a functional 4-bit shift register in line with the specified operational requirements.
