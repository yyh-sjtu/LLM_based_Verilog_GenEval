Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as specified. This module consists of a 4-bit right shift register that supports asynchronous reset, load, and enable functionalities. 

Here's the Verilog code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire areset,
    input  wire load,
    input  wire ena,
    input  wire [3:0] data,
    output reg  [3:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            // Asynchronous reset
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else if (load) begin
            // Load data into the shift register
            q <= data;
        end else if (ena) begin
            // Shift right logic
            q <= {1'b0, q[3:1]};
        end
        // If neither load nor ena are asserted, q retains its value
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input/Output Ports:**
   - `clk`: Clock signal for the synchronous operations.
   - `areset`: Asynchronous reset signal; when asserted, it resets the register.
   - `load`: Signal to load new data into the register.
   - `ena`: Signal to enable shifting of the register.
   - `data`: 4-bit input data for loading into the register.
   - `q`: 4-bit output representing the current state of the shift register.

2. **Reset Logic:**
   - The `areset` signal is checked first due to its asynchronous nature. If it is asserted, the register `q` is reset to `4'b0000`.

3. **Load Logic:**
   - If the `load` signal is asserted and `areset` is not, the data input is loaded into the register `q`.

4. **Shift Logic:**
   - If `ena` is asserted—after checking the `load` condition—then the register shifts right. The most significant bit (`q[3]`) is replaced with `0`, and the remaining bits shift right.

5. **Retain Value Logic:**
   - If neither `load` nor `ena` is asserted, the output `q` retains its previous value.

### Notes:
- The order of conditions in the `always` block is crucial—`areset` is checked first, followed by `load` to ensure that loading takes priority over shifting when both are high.
- Make sure to test the module thoroughly using a testbench to validate behavior under various conditions (resetting, loading, shifting, and combinations thereof).
