Here is an RTL implementation of the TopModule with the specified interface:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

// Decade counter logic
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0001;
    end else begin
        if (q == 4'b1010) begin
            q <= 4'b0001;
        end else begin
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code implements a decade counter that counts from 1 to 10 in binary representation. The counter is reset to 1 when the reset input is high and increments on each positive edge of the clock signal. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.
