Certainly! Below is an implementation of a `TopModule` which serves as a decade counter counting from 1 to 10. The module is created using Verilog.

### Verilog Code for the Decade Counter Module

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

// Initial state for the counter
initial begin
    q = 4'b0001; // Start counting from 1
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0001; // Reset the counter to 1
    end else begin
        if (q == 4'b1010) begin // Check if q has reached 10
            q <= 4'b0001; // Wrap around to 1
        end else begin
            q <= q + 1; // Increment the counter
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Module Definition**: The `TopModule` takes in a clock (`clk`), a synchronous reset (`reset`), and produces a 4-bit output (`q`) as specified in the interface.

2. **Initial Condition**: The `initial` block initializes `q` to `4'b0001`, indicating the counter starts at 1.

3. **Always Block**: The synchronous behavior is captured inside an `always` block triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
   - **Reset Logic**: If `reset` is high, the counter is reset to 1 (`4'b0001`).
   - **Counting Logic**: If `q` reaches `4'b1010` (which represents the decimal value 10), the counter wraps back to `4'b0001`. Otherwise, it increments by 1.

### Usage

This module can be instantiated in a top-level testbench or another module as required. The clock signal should be driven appropriately, and the reset signal can be asserted to check the synchronous reset behavior.
