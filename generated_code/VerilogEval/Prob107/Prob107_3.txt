Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` described in your request. This module represents a Moore state machine with two states (A and B), one input (`in`), and one output (`out`). The output is determined by the current state of the machine.

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input in,
    output reg out
);

// State encoding
typedef enum reg [1:0] {
    B = 2'b00, // State B
    A = 2'b01  // State A
} state_t;

// State register
state_t current_state, next_state;

// Synchronous state transition
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        current_state <= B; // Reset to state B
    end else begin
        current_state <= next_state; // Transition to the next state
    end
end

// Next state logic
always @(*) begin
    case (current_state)
        B: begin
            if (in == 0) begin
                next_state = A; // B --in=0--> A
                out = 1; // Output 1 in state B
            end else begin
                next_state = B; // B --in=1--> B
                out = 1; // Output 1 in state B
            end
        end
        A: begin
            if (in == 0) begin
                next_state = B; // A --in=0--> B
                out = 0; // Output 0 in state A
            end else begin
                next_state = A; // A --in=1--> A
                out = 0; // Output 0 in state A
            end
        end
        default: begin
            next_state = B; // Fallback to state B if undefined state
            out = 1; // Default output in state B
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**: 
   - States are defined using an enumerated type for better readability. We have `B` (encoded as `2'b00`) and `A` (encoded as `2'b01`).

2. **State Register**:
   - The current state is updated on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`) or when `reset` is high.

3. **Next State Logic**:
   - Depending on the current state and the input (`in`), the next state (`next_state`) is determined. 
   - In state `B`, if `in` is `0`, it transitions to `A`; if `in` is `1`, it stays in `B`.
   - In state `A`, if `in` is `0`, it transitions back to `B`; if `in` is `1`, it remains in `A`.
   - The output is set based on the current state: `out = 1` when in state `B` and `out = 0` when in state `A`.

4. **Reset Behavior**:
   - The machine resets to state `B` when `reset` is high.

### Notes:
- The above code assumes a synchronous reset. The output is registered and is updated based on the current state, following Moore machine principles.
- Make sure to simulate and test the module to ensure its correctness in your specific FPGA/ASIC development environment.
