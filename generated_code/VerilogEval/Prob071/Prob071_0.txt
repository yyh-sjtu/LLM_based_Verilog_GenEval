As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [2:0] pos
);

always @(*) begin
    case(in)
        8'b00000001: pos = 3'b0;
        8'b00000010: pos = 3'b1;
        8'b00000100: pos = 3'b2;
        8'b00001000: pos = 3'b3;
        8'b00010000: pos = 3'b4;
        8'b00100000: pos = 3'b5;
        8'b01000000: pos = 3'b6;
        8'b10000000: pos = 3'b7;
        default: pos = 3'b0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This module implements a priority encoder for an 8-bit input as per the given requirements. The logic within the 'always' block checks the input vector and assigns the corresponding output value based on the first (least significant) bit that is high. If no bits are high in the input vector, it outputs 3'b0.
