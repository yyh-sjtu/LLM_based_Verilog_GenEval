To implement the TopModule module in RTL, we need to define the state transitions for each cell based on Rule 110. We will also need to implement the logic to shift the state of each cell based on its neighbors.

Here is a high-level description of the RTL implementation for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q // Output registers for the state of each cell
);

reg [511:0] next_q; // Next state of each cell

// Sequential logic for updating the state of each cell based on Rule 110
always @ (posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data; // Load initial state from data when load is high
    end else begin
        next_q[0] = (q[1] & q[0] & 1'b0) | (q[1] & ~q[0] & 1'b1) | (~q[1] & q[0] & 1'b1) | (~q[1] & ~q[0] & 1'b0);
        next_q[511] = 1'b0; // Boundary condition for q[512]
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 511; i = i+1) begin
            next_q[i] = (q[i+1] & q[i] & 1'b0) | (q[i+1] & ~q[i] & 1'b1) | (~q[i+1] & q[i] & 1'b1) | (~q[i+1] & ~q[i] & 1'b0);
        end
        
        q <= next_q; // Update the state of each cell
    end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines the TopModule with the specified interface and implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton logic. It updates the state of each cell based on its neighbors at each clock cycle and loads the initial state when the load input is high. The module assumes zero boundaries at q[-1] and q[512].
