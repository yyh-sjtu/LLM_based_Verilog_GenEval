As a professional RTL designer, I would start by creating the TopModule RTL design in Verilog. Here is the code that implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

reg [511:0] next_state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data;
    end else begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
            if (i == 0) begin
                next_state[i] = (q[i] & q[i+1]) ^ 1;
            end else if (i == 511) begin
                next_state[i] = (q[i-1] & q[i]) ^ 1;
            end else begin
                next_state[i] = ((q[i-1] & q[i]) & !q[i+1]) |
                                ((q[i-1] & !q[i]) & q[i+1]) |
                                ((!q[i-1] & q[i]) & q[i+1]);
            end
        end
        q <= next_state;
    end
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the TopModule module takes in the clock signal, load signal, data input, and outputs the state of the cellular automaton in the q output. The Rule 110 logic is implemented within the always block, where the next state of each cell is computed based on its current state and the states of its neighbors.

I would simulate this design using a Verilog simulator to ensure its correctness and then synthesize it for the target FPGA or ASIC technology. Additionally, thorough testing and verification procedures would be conducted to ensure the functionality and correctness of the design before moving forward with physical implementation.
