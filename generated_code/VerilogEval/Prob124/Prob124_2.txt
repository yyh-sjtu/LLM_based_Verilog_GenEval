To implement the TopModule module with Rule 110, we will create a Verilog RTL design as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

reg [511:0] next_state; // Next state for each cell

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data;
    end else begin
        // Apply Rule 110 to each cell
        for (int i = 0; i < 512; i++) begin
            if (i == 0) begin
                next_state[i] = (q[0] & ~q[1]) | (~q[0] & ~q[1]);
            end else if (i == 511) begin
                next_state[i] = (~q[510] & q[511]) | (~q[510] & ~q[511]);
            end else begin
                next_state[i] = (~q[i-1] & q[i] & q[i+1]) | (~q[i-1] & ~q[i] & q[i+1]) | (~q[i-1] & ~q[i] & ~q[i+1]) | (q[i-1] & ~q[i] & q[i+1]);
            end
        end
        
        q <= next_state; // Update current state with next state
    end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog module will implement Rule 110 as described in the specification. The `next_state` register holds the calculated next state for each cell, which is then applied to update the current state in each clock cycle. The `load` input is used to load initial data into the cell system.

Please ensure to verify and simulate this design thoroughly before synthesis and implementation in hardware. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
