As a professional RTL designer, I understand the requirements for implementing the TopModule module that simulates Rule 110 cellular automaton. I will create a Verilog module that follows the provided specifications. Here is the code for implementing the TopModule module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

reg [511:0] next_q;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data;
    end else begin
        next_q[0] = (q[0] & ~q[1]) | (~q[0] & ~q[1]);
        for (int i = 1; i < 511; i = i + 1) begin
            next_q[i] = (q[i-1] & q[i] & ~q[i+1]) | (q[i-1] & ~q[i] & q[i+1]) | (~q[i-1] & q[i] & q[i+1]) | (~q[i-1] & ~q[i] & ~q[i+1]);
        end
        next_q[511] = (q[510] & q[511]) | (q[510] & ~q[511]);

        q <= next_q;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates the TopModule module with the specified interface and implements the Rule 110 cellular automaton logic. The module contains a 512-bit array q to represent the cells and updates the state of each cell based on the rules of Rule 110. The load input is used to initialize the system with the provided data when triggered.

Please let me know if you need any further explanation or modification to the code.
