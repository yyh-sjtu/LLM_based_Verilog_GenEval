Here is the Verilog code for the module TopModule that implements an AND gate using both an assign statement and a combinational always block:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    output out_assign,
    output out_alwaysblock
);

// Using assign statement to implement AND gate
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Using combinational always block to implement AND gate
always @(*) begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
end

endmodule
```

This module has input ports a and b, and output ports out_assign and out_alwaysblock. The output out_assign is driven by an assign statement which performs the AND operation between inputs a and b. The output out_alwaysblock is driven by a combinational always block which also performs the AND operation between inputs a and b.
