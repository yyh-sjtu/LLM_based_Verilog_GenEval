Certainly! Below is an example of how you can implement the `TopModule` in Verilog, which includes both an `assign` statement and a combinational `always` block to create an AND gate.

### Verilog Code for `TopModule`

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_alwaysblock
);

// Implementing AND gate using assign statement
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Implementing AND gate using always block
always @(*) begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - The module has two inputs: `a` and `b`, which are one-bit wide.
   - It has two outputs: `out_assign` and `out_alwaysblock`.

2. **AND Gate Using Assign Statement**:
   - `assign out_assign = a & b;` uses an `assign` statement to directly drive `out_assign` with the logical AND of `a` and `b`.

3. **AND Gate Using Always Block**:
   - The `always @(*)` block is a combinational block that triggers whenever there are changes in inputs `a` or `b`.
   - Inside this block, the output `out_alwaysblock` is assigned the result of `a & b`.

### Notes:
- Both outputs will provide the same functionality, which is the logical AND of `a` and `b`.
- The `out_assign` is driven by continuous assignment, while `out_alwaysblock` is driven by procedural assignment inside the always block.
