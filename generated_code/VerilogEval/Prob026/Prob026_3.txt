Sure! Below is an example of how to implement the `TopModule` in Verilog that includes both the assign statement and a combinational always block to perform the AND operation.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg  out_alwaysblock
);

// Assign statement for AND operation
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Combinational always block for AND operation
always @* begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: We define a module named `TopModule` with inputs and outputs as specified.

2. **Assign Statement**: `assign out_assign = a & b;` directly computes the AND of `a` and `b` and assigns it to `out_assign`.

3. **Combinational Always Block**: The `always @*` block is triggered whenever there is a change in any of its input signals. Inside the block, the same AND operation is performed, and the result is assigned to `out_alwaysblock`.

You can instantiate this module in a top-level design or testbench to verify its functionality. Make sure to simulate it to observe the output behavior.
