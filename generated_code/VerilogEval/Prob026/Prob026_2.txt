Sure! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule`. This module includes an AND gate that operates using both an `assign` statement and a combinational `always` block.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg  out_alwaysblock
);

// Continuous assignment using assign statement for AND operation
assign out_assign = a & b;

// Combinational logic using always block for AND operation
always @(*) begin
    out_alwaysblock = a & b;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and has two input ports (`a` and `b`) of type `wire`, as well as two output ports (`out_assign` of type `wire` and `out_alwaysblock` of type `reg`).

2. **Assign Statement**: 
   - `assign out_assign = a & b;` continuously assigns the result of the AND operation between `a` and `b` to `out_assign`.

3. **Always Block**: 
   - The `always @(*)` block is sensitive to any changes in the inputs `a` and `b`, ensuring that `out_alwaysblock` is updated accordingly whenever there is a change in either input.
   - Inside the always block, `out_alwaysblock = a & b;` performs the same AND operation.

This design succinctly illustrates how to implement the same functionality using two different methods in Verilog.
