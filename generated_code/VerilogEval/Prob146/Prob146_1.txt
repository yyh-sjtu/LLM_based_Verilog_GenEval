To implement the TopModule with the specified interface, we will design a finite state machine to handle the reception of serial data bits and identify when a complete byte has been correctly received. Here is a high-level overview of the FSM:

- State 0: Idle state, waiting for start bit (0) to be detected.
- State 1-8: Waiting for each data bit to be received.
- State 9: Waiting for stop bit (1) to be detected.

We will also include a reset signal to ensure proper initialization of the FSM. The FSM will transition between states based on the received bits and the current state. When a complete byte is received and the stop bit is correct, the FSM will assert the done signal and output the received byte on out_byte. If the stop bit is incorrect or missing, the FSM will wait until it finds a valid stop bit before attempting to receive the next byte.

I will now proceed to implement the RTL code for the TopModule based on the above requirements.
