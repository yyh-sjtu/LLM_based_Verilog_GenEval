Here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementation based on the provided simulation waveforms:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk,
    input a,
    input b,
    output reg q,
    output reg state
);

reg flip_flop;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    state <= flip_flop;
    flip_flop <= a & ~b;
    q <= flip_flop;
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with the specified interface. It implements a sequential circuit with one flip-flop and combinational logic based on the provided simulation waveforms. The flip-flop is triggered on the positive edge of the clock and the output state reflects the value of the flip-flop. The combinational logic determines the next state of the flip-flop based on inputs a and b.
