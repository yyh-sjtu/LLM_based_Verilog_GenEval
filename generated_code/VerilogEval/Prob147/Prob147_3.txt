To implement the `TopModule`, we will analyze the provided waveform data. The important characteristics observed from the waveform include certain patterns and transitions for signals `a`, `b`, `state`, and `q`. 

Here's a breakdown of the observations and a proposed logic implementation:

### Observations:
- The output `state` seems to change from `1` to `0` when certain conditions apply. 
- The memory element (flip-flop) is controlled by `clk` and changes on the positive edge, storing the output `state`.
- The behavior of `state` appears to depend on `a` and `b`. For example:
    - At `45ns`, when `a` was `1` and `b` was `0`, `state` became `1`.
    - After that, even when `a` was toggled, if `b` was `0`, the output stayed `1`.
    - If both `a` and `b` are `1`, `state` might change to `0`.

### The Logic:
1. **Next State Logic**: It seems the next value of `state` will depend primarily on the values of `a` and `b`.
2. If `a` is `1` and `b` is `0`, it will set the `state` to `1`.
3. If both inputs are `1` at the previous clock cycle, then it seems to reset `state` to `0`.

### RTL Implementation:
Here is the suggested RTL code for the `TopModule`, written in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    input b,
    output reg q,
    output reg state
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    // Sequential logic for the flip-flop
    state <= (a && ~b) ? 1 : ((~a && b) ? 0 : state); // Update state based on conditions
    q <= state; // Output the current state, storing it in q
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Clock Triggering**: The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
2. **State Logic**:
   - If `a` is `1` and `b` is `0`, `state` is set to `1`.
   - If both inputs are `0`, `state` remains unchanged.
   - If `b` is `1`, the `state` is reset to `0`.
3. **Output Assignment**: The output `q` reflects the current value of the `state`.

This assumes that the behavior captured in the waveform is complete, and it models the circuit based on the observed transitions and outputs.
