To implement the specified `TopModule` as a Mealy finite state machine (FSM) using one-hot encoding, we'll follow the given state transitions and behaviors. Let's break down the requirements:

1. We have two states: 
    - **State A:** (Reset state)
    - **State B:**

2. The transitions and output behaviors are:
    - From State A, if `x` is 0, remain in A and output `z = 0`.
    - From State A, if `x` is 1, transition to B and output `z = 1`.
    - From State B, if `x` is 0, remain in B and output `z = 1`.
    - From State B, if `x` is 1, remain in B and output `z = 0`.

### VHDL Implementation:

Here's a sample RTL implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input       clk,
    input       areset,
    input       x,
    output reg  z
);

    // State encoding using one-hot encoding
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        A = 2'b01,
        B = 2'b10
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Sequential logic for state transition
    always @(posedge clk or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset) begin
            current_state <= A; // Reset to state A
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state; // Transition to next state
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic for next state and output
    always @(*) begin
        // Default values
        next_state = current_state;
        z = 1'b0;

        case (current_state)
            A: begin
                if (x) begin
                    next_state = B; // Transition to B
                    z = 1'b1;       // Output z = 1
                end // if x == 0, z remains 0 and stay in state A
            end

            B: begin
                if (x) begin
                    z = 1'b0; // Output z = 0
                end else begin
                    // x is 0, remain in B
                    z = 1'b1; // Output z = 1
                end
            end

            default: begin
                next_state = A; // Default to state A for safety
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Description of the Code:

1. **State Definitions:** 
   - The states are defined using an enumerated type (`state_t`), where `A` is represented as `2'b01` and `B` as `2'b10`.

2. **State Transition Logic:**
   - The next state is calculated in a combinational always block and assigned during the positive edge of the clock.
   - If the `areset` signal is high, the FSM resets to state A.

3. **Output Logic:**
   - Output `z` is calculated as part of the combinational logic, depending on the current state and the input `x`. 

4. **Safety Default Assignment:**
   - A default case is included to ensure that in case of undefined states, the FSM will default back to state A.

### Note:
- Ensure that the simulation and synthesis tools you are using are set up to support this coding style and that the code meets your specific design requirements and constraints in practice.
