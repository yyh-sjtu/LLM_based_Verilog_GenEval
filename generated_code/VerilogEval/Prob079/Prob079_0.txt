To implement the specified `TopModule`, we need to derive the next state and output logic based on the provided state transition table for the Moore state machine. I'll guide you through deriving the logic equations and then provide the Verilog code for the module.

### State Transition and Output Logic Analysis

1. **States**:
   - A = 4'b0001
   - B = 4'b0010
   - C = 4'b0100
   - D = 4'b1000

2. **Next State Logic**:
   - **For State A**:
     - If `in = 0`: Stay in **A** (next_state = 4'b0001)
     - If `in = 1`: Transition to **B** (next_state = 4'b0010)

   - **For State B**:
     - If `in = 0`: Transition to **C** (next_state = 4'b0100)
     - If `in = 1`: Stay in **B** (next_state = 4'b0010)

   - **For State C**:
     - If `in = 0`: Transition to **A** (next_state = 4'b0001)
     - If `in = 1`: Transition to **D** (next_state = 4'b1000)

   - **For State D**:
     - If `in = 0`: Transition to **C** (next_state = 4'b0100)
     - If `in = 1`: Transition to **B** (next_state = 4'b0010)

3. **Next State Logic Equations**:
   Let's denote the current state by `state[3:0]` (one-hot encoding). We can derive the next state using the current state's value and the input `in`:
   - **next_state[0] (A)**: 
     - `next_state[0] = (state[3] & ~in) | (state[2] & in) | (state[1] & ~in)`

   - **next_state[1] (B)**: 
     - `next_state[1] = (state[0] & in) | (state[3] & in)`

   - **next_state[2] (C)**: 
     - `next_state[2] = (state[1] & ~in) | (state[0] & in)`

   - **next_state[3] (D)**: 
     - `next_state[3] = (state[2] & in) | (state[0] & ~in)`

4. **Output Logic**:
   The output only depends on the current state:
   - `out = state[3]` (D is the only state that gives output 1)

### Verilog Code Implementation

Here is the complete Verilog code for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire in,
    input  wire [3:0] state,
    output wire [3:0] next_state,
    output wire out
);

    // Next state logic
    assign next_state[0] = (state[3] & ~in) | (state[2] & in) | (state[1] & ~in); // Next state A
    assign next_state[1] = (state[0] & in) | (state[3] & in);                    // Next state B
    assign next_state[2] = (state[1] & ~in) | (state[0] & in);                   // Next state C
    assign next_state[3] = (state[2] & in) | (state[0] & ~in);                   // Next state D

    // Output logic
    assign out = state[3]; // Output is high if in state D

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code
- The module has one input port `in`, a 4-bit input port `state`, and outputs `next_state` (4 bits) and `out` (1 bit).
- The `assign` statements implement the derived next state and output logic.
- The `next_state` is determined based on current state and input according to the specified state transition table.
- The output `out` simply reflects whether the machine is in state D.
