Here's a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` finite-state machine (FSM) to meet your requirements. The FSM will monitor the input `data`, detect the specific pattern `1101`, and manage the output signals accordingly. 

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input data,
    input done_counting,
    input ack,
    output reg shift_ena,
    output reg counting,
    output reg done
);
    
    // State encoding
    typedef enum reg [2:0] {
        IDLE,        // Waiting for pattern 1101
        SHIFTING,    // Shifting in 4 bits
        COUNTING,    // Waiting for done counting
        DONE         // Timer timed out
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;
    reg [3:0] shift_counter; // Counter to manage shift operation

    // State transition
    always @ (posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= IDLE;
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @ (*) begin
        // Default assignments for outputs
        shift_ena = 0;
        counting = 0;
        done = 0;
        next_state = current_state; // Default to hold current state
        
        case (current_state)
            IDLE: begin
                // Wait for the sequence 1101 
                if (shift_counter == 3) begin
                    // After receiving 1101
                    next_state = SHIFTING;
                    shift_counter = 0; // Reset for post pattern shifting
                end else if (data) begin
                    shift_counter = shift_counter + 1; // Increment for each bit
                end else begin
                    shift_counter = 0; // Reset on mismatch
                end
            end
            
            SHIFTING: begin
                // Shift for 4 clock cycles
                shift_ena = 1;
                if (shift_counter < 3) begin
                    shift_counter = shift_counter + 1;
                end else begin
                    next_state = COUNTING;
                    counting = 1; // Indicate that we are counting
                end
            end
            
            COUNTING: begin
                if (done_counting) begin
                    next_state = DONE; // Move to done state
                end
            end

            DONE: begin
                done = 1; // Notify user timer has timed out
                if (ack) begin
                    next_state = IDLE; // Reset to wait for the next pattern
                end
            end
            
            default: next_state = IDLE; // Default state
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Components Explained:
- **State Encoding**: Four states are defined—`IDLE`, `SHIFTING`, `COUNTING`, and `DONE`—to represent the various stages of the timer function.
- **State Transition Logic**: The actions taken during each state are defined within a `case` statement in the `next_state` logic.
- **Reset Behavior**: Active-high synchronous reset sets the state back to `IDLE`, preparing to look for the `1101` pattern.
- **Shift Enable Signal**: `shift_ena` is asserted for a fixed duration when entering the `SHIFTING` state.
- **Counting Logic**: The FSM moves to the `COUNTING` state after `SHIFTING` and waits for a `done_counting` signal.
- **Final Notification**: Upon completing the counting, the FSM indicates completion (the `done` signal) and then waits for an acknowledgment (the `ack` signal) before returning to the `IDLE` state.

### Note:
This implementation assumes sequential logic triggered at the positive clock edge and utilizes a simple register to manage the state and transition to the next state based on conditions. Adjustments may be needed based on complete system tests and specific constraints of the design environment.
