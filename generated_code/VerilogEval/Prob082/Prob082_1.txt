Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of a `TopModule` that represents a 32-bit Galois LFSR with the specified taps and synchronous reset behavior.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  reset,
    output reg [31:0] q
);

    // Define the feedback logic for the Galois LFSR
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // On reset, set output to 32'h1
            q <= 32'h1;
        end else begin
            // Shift left and apply the feedback based on the tap positions
            q[31:1] <= q[30:0]; // Shift left
            q[0] <= q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0]; // Feedback from taps at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The `TopModule` has three ports: `clk` (clock), `reset` (active high reset), and `q` (32-bit output).

2. **Synchronous Reset**: The LFSR resets to `32'h1` when `reset` is high. This operation occurs in the same always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **LFSR Logic**: In each clock cycle, if not resetting, the LFSR shifts left, and the new least significant bit (LSB) is computed from the feedback logic:
   - Taps are utilized at position 32 (most significant bit), 22, 2, and 1 for XOR feedback computation.
   - The new value of `q[0]` is computed using `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and the current `q[0]`.

4. **Non-blocking Assignment**: The use of non-blocking assignment (`<=`) in an always block ensures that the sequential logic behaves correctly with respect to the clock.

This implementation meets the requirement for a synchronous reset and follows the properties of a Galois LFSR as specified.
