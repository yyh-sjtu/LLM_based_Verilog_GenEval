Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation of a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with the specified characteristics:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  reset,
    output reg [31:0] q
);

    // On reset, initialize q to 32'h1
    // Galois LFSR tap positions are 32, 22, 2, and 1
    // The feedback equation corresponds to:
    // new_bit = q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0]
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 32'h1; // Synchronous reset to 1
        end else begin
            // Calculate new bit (feedback)
            q <= {q[30:0], (q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0])}; // Shift and insert the feedback bit
        end
    end
    
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Definition**: The `TopModule` is defined with inputs `clk` and `reset`, and output `q` which is a 32-bit register.

2. **Reset Behavior**: The reset is active high and synchronous. When the `reset` signal is high, `q` is set to `32'h1`.

3. **Galois LFSR Logic**: During every positive clock edge (if not in reset):
   - The new bit fed into the LFSR is computed as the XOR of `q[31]`, `q[21]`, `q[1]`, and `q[0]`.
   - The current bits in `q` are shifted left by one position, and the computed feedback bit is placed in the least significant bit (LSB).

4. **Bit Shifting and Feedback**: The shift operation `{q[30:0], new_bit}` ensures that the register evolves as expected while incorporating the feedback based on the specified taps.

### Summary
The provided code snippet successfully implements a 32-bit Galois LFSR with synchronous reset behavior. You can simulate or synthesize this design in a hardware description language simulator or synthesize it on FPGA for practical applications.
