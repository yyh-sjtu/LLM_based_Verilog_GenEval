Certainly! Below is a Verilog code implementation for a `TopModule` that meets your specified requirements for a 32-bit Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR):

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire reset,
    output reg [31:0] q
);

    // Galois LFSR feedback taps: 32, 22, 2, and 1
    wire feedback = q[31] ^ q[21] ^ q[1] ^ q[0]; // Tap positions 32, 22, 2, and 1

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 32'h1; // Reset output to 32'h1 on synchronous reset
        end else begin
            // Shift register operation
            q <= {q[30:0], feedback}; // Shift the register and insert feedback bit
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is defined with the required input and output ports.
2. **Feedback Calculation**: The `feedback` wire computes the next input for the MSB (most significant bit) of the register. The feedback is the XOR of the bits at the specified tap positions.
3. **Always Block**: 
   - It is triggered on the rising edge of the `clk`.
   - If the `reset` signal is high, `q` is set to `32'h1`. This is a synchronous reset, meaning it only takes effect on the clock edge.
   - If not resetting, the contents of `q` are shifted left by 1 bit, and the feedback value is inserted into the least significant bit (LSB).
  
### Usage:
- This LFSR can be instantiated in a higher-level module or tested with a testbench that drives the `clk` and `reset` signals. 
- The operation of the LFSR will yield a sequence of bits based on the initial state defined by the reset signal.
