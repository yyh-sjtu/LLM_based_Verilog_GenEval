Here is a possible implementation of the TopModule in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [31:0] q
);

reg [31:0] lfsr;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        lfsr <= 32'h1;
    end else begin
        lfsr <= {lfsr[30:0], lfsr[31] ^ lfsr[21] ^ lfsr[1] ^ lfsr[0]};
    end
end

assign q = lfsr;

endmodule
```

This code defines a module TopModule with a 32-bit register lfsr representing the Galois LFSR. The reset signal is used to reset the output q to 1. On each positive clock edge, the lfsr value is updated based on the taps at bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1 using XOR gates. The output q is driven by the lfsr register. 

This implementation follows the required specifications for a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at specific bit positions and synchronous reset functionality.
