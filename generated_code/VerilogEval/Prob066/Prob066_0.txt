As a professional RTL designer, I would start by writing the Verilog code for the TopModule module as per the given interface requirements.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [31:0] in,
    output reg [31:0] out
);

reg [31:0] prev_in;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        out <= 32'b0;
        prev_in <= in;
    end else begin
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i=i+1) begin
            if (prev_in[i] && !in[i]) begin
                out[i] <= 1;
            end else begin
                out[i] <= 0;
            end
        end
        prev_in <= in;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code snippet captures the change from 1 to 0 in each bit of the 32-bit input vector and holds the captured value in the output until the reset signal is triggered. The synchronous reset ensures that the output is reset to 0 in the next clock cycle after the reset signal is activated.

I would proceed to simulate and synthesize the design to ensure its functionality and performance meet the desired requirements. Additionally, I would conduct thorough verification and timing analysis to validate the correctness and efficiency of the implementation.
