Certainly! Below is an RTL (Register Transfer Level) implementation of a module named `TopModule` as per your specifications. We'll use Verilog, a popular hardware description language, for this implementation.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire [31:0] in,
    output reg out
);

    // Internal signal to track the previous state of input
    reg [31:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset
            out <= 1'b0;          // Reset the output
            prev_in <= 32'b0;     // Reset the previous input
        end else begin
            // Check for rising edge from 1 to 0 in any of the bits
            if (prev_in == 1'b1 && in == 1'b0) begin
                out <= 1'b1;      // Set output to 1 if condition is met
            end else begin
                out <= out;       // Maintain current output state
            end
            
            // Update previous input for the next cycle
            prev_in <= in;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Ports**:
    - `clk`: Clock input.
    - `reset`: Active high synchronous reset signal.
    - `in`: A 32-bit input vector.
    - `out`: A 32-bit output vector indicating the captured state.

2. **Internal Signal**:
    - `prev_in`: A 32-bit register that holds the value of `in` from the previous clock cycle.

3. **Always Block**:
    - Triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
    - If `reset` is high, the output (`out`) and `prev_in` are reset to 0.
    - Otherwise, it checks if there is a transition from 1 to 0 in any bit of the `in` vector:
        - If the previous input was 1 (`prev_in == 1`) and the current input is 0 (`in == 0`), it sets `out` to 1.
        - If the condition isn't met, it maintains the current state of the output.
    - The `prev_in` is updated with the current input at the end of each clock cycle.

### Important Points:
- The output `out` will maintain its state high (1) until a reset is triggered.
- Ensure that `out` is defined as a reg type since it behaves as a storage element that reflects changes on the clock edge.
