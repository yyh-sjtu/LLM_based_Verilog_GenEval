Certainly! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog that meets your specifications. The module will monitor a 32-bit input vector for transitions from `1` to `0`. When such a transition is detected, it sets a corresponding bit in the 32-bit output to `1` until the reset is activated.

Hereâ€™s the RTL code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire        clk,     // Clock input
    input  wire        reset,   // Synchronous reset input
    input  wire [31:0] in,      // 32-bit input
    output reg  [31:0] out      // 32-bit output
);

    reg [31:0] prev_in; // Register to hold the previous state of the input

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            out <= 32'b0; // Reset the output to 0
            prev_in <= 32'b0; // Reset previous input state
        end else begin
            // Capture rising edge transitions from 1 to 0 in the input
            for (int i = 0; i < 32; i = i + 1) begin
                if (prev_in[i] == 1'b1 && in[i] == 1'b0) begin
                    out[i] <= 1'b1; // Transition detected: set output
                end
            end
            // Update previous input state
            prev_in <= in;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Definition**: The module is defined with the specified inputs and outputs.
2. **Registers**:
    - `prev_in`: A register to keep track of the previous state of the 32-bit input vector.
3. **Always Block**:
    - Triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
    - First, it checks for the `reset` signal. When `reset` is high, it clears both the `out` and `prev_in` registers.
    - If not resetting, it checks every bit of the `prev_in` and the current `in` to find any transitions from `1` to `0`. If such a transition is detected on a bit, the corresponding bit in `out` is set to `1`.
    - After evaluating, it updates `prev_in` to the current `in` for the next clock cycle.

### Considerations:
- Ensure correct simulation models are used to test the functionality.
- Be aware of the synthesis tools as they may have specific handling of `for` loops in combinatorial logic.
- In real-world applications, debouncing or additional state management might be needed depending on the input nature.
