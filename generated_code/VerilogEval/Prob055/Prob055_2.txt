Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of a module named `TopModule` that takes four 8-bit input values (a, b, c, d) and outputs the minimum of these values.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    input  [7:0] c,
    input  [7:0] d,
    output [7:0] min
);

    // Intermediate variable to hold minimum value
    reg [7:0] min_reg;

    always @(*) begin
        // Initial assumption
        min_reg = a;

        // Compare with b
        if (b < min_reg) min_reg = b;
        
        // Compare with c
        if (c < min_reg) min_reg = c;
        
        // Compare with d
        if (d < min_reg) min_reg = d;
    end

    // Assign the minimum value to the output
    assign min = min_reg;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is defined with the specified input and output ports.

2. **Intermediate Register**: A register `min_reg` is used to hold the minimum value found during comparisons.

3. **Always Block**: This block is triggered whenever there is a change in any of the inputs:
   - It initializes `min_reg` to `a`.
   - Then, it sequentially compares `min_reg` with each of the other inputs (`b`, `c`, `d`) and updates `min_reg` accordingly.

4. **Output Assignment**: The minimum value is assigned to the output port `min`.

### Usage:
To use this module in a design, you simply create instances of `TopModule`, providing appropriate connections for `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and reading `min` as the output. This implementation efficiently finds the minimum of the four 8-bit unsigned integers through simple comparisons.
