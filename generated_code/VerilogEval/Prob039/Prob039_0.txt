Certainly! Below is an example of how to implement the `TopModule` in Verilog, featuring both an assign statement for continuous assignment and a procedural block (always block) for the behavioral implementation.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire sel_b1,
    input  wire sel_b2,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg  out_always
);

    // Continuous assignment using assign statement
    assign out_assign = (sel_b1 & sel_b2) ? b : a;

    // Procedural assignment using always block
    always @(*) begin
        if (sel_b1 & sel_b2) begin
            out_always = b;
        end else begin
            out_always = a;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**: 
   - `TopModule` is declared with input ports `a`, `b`, `sel_b1`, `sel_b2`, and output ports `out_assign` and `out_always`.

2. **Continuous Assignment**:
   - The `assign` statement allows for combinatorial logic. Here, `out_assign` checks if `sel_b1` and `sel_b2` are both true (1). If they are, it assigns the value of `b` to `out_assign`; otherwise, it assigns the value of `a`.

3. **Procedural Assignment**:
   - The `always @(*)` block is used for describing combinatorial logic. Inside the block, it uses an if-else statement to achieve the same logic as the continuous assignment.
   - `out_always` is updated based on the condition of `sel_b1` and `sel_b2`. If both are true, it assigns `b` to `out_always`, otherwise assigns `a`.

This setup ensures that both approaches yield the same results based on the given input signals.
