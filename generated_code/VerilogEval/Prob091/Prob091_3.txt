To implement the `TopModule` that corresponds to the finite-state machine (FSM) given in your specification, we'll derive the state transition logic based on the one-hot encoding of the states A, B, C, D, E, and F.

### State Encoding:
Given the one-hot state encoding:
- A = `000001`
- B = `000010`
- C = `000100`
- D = `001000`
- E = `010000`
- F = `100000`

### Next State Logic:
Next, we need to analyze the transitions based on the FSM diagram provided:

1. **From State A (`000001`)**:
   - On input `1` → go to B (`000010`).
   - On input `0` → stay in A (`000001`).

2. **From State B (`000010`)**:
   - On input `1` → go to C (`000100`).
   - On input `0` → go to D (`001000`).

3. **From State C (`000100`)**:
   - On input `1` → go to E (`010000`).
   - On input `0` → go to D (`001000`).

4. **From State D (`001000`)**:
   - On input `1` → go to F (`100000`).
   - On input `0` → go back to A (`000001`).

5. **From State E (`010000`)**:
   - On input `1` → stay in E (`010000`).
   - On input `0` → go to D (`001000`).

6. **From State F (`100000`)**:
   - On input `1` → go to C (`000100`).
   - On input `0` → go to D (`001000`).

### Outputs:
- According to your specification:
  - The output `Y1` should be the input of state flip-flop y[1].
  - The output `Y3` should be the input of state flip-flop y[3].
  
From the transitions we can deduce:
- Y1 is `1` if the FSM is in state B (`000010`).
- Y3 is `1` if the FSM is in state D (`001000`).

### RTL Implementation:
We'll implement the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [5:0] y,   // State input (one-hot)
    input w,         // Input signal
    output Y1,       // Output for state flip-flop y[1]
    output Y3        // Output for state flip-flop y[3]
);

    // Assign outputs based on the current state
    assign Y1 = y[1];  // Y1 is 1 when in State B
    assign Y3 = y[3];  // Y3 is 1 when in State D

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The module has a simple structure where `Y1` and `Y3` outputs correspond directly to the bits in the one-hot encoded state representation. 
- `Y1` is driven by `y[1]`, which indicates whether the FSM is in state B.
- `Y3` is driven by `y[3]`, indicating whether the FSM is in state D.

With this implementation, we represent the desired FSM output states based on the one-hot encoding, finishing our design as per the specifications you provided.
