As a professional RTL designer, I would analyze the given simulation waveforms to understand the behavior of the circuit described by the TopModule interface. Based on the waveforms provided, it appears that the output q is generated based on the following logic:

- q = a AND (NOT b OR c OR d)

To implement this logic in Verilog, the TopModule can be designed as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

always @*
begin
    if (a & (~b | c | d))
        q = 1;
    else
        q = 0;
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code captures the combinational logic described by the simulation waveforms. The circuit should now behave according to the specified truth table.
