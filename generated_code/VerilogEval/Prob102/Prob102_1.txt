As a professional RTL designer, I would start by analyzing the truth table provided to understand the behavior of the combinational circuit described in the waveforms.

Based on the given waveforms, the TopModule can be implemented as follows in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output q
);

assign q = (a & b) | (~b & c) | (c & d);

endmodule
```

The implemented logic corresponds to the truth table provided in the waveforms. The module takes four inputs (a, b, c, and d) and generates the output q based on the defined logic. I have taken into account the changing input values at different time intervals to make sure the output q matches the expected behavior.

This Verilog code can be synthesized and verified using RTL simulation tools to ensure it behaves as expected and implements the desired combinational circuit.
