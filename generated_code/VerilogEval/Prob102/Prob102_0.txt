As a professional RTL designer, I will implement the TopModule module based on the provided simulation waveforms. 

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output q
);

assign q = (b & c) | (a & d);

endmodule
```

The logic implemented in this module matches the behavior described in the simulation waveforms provided. Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications.
