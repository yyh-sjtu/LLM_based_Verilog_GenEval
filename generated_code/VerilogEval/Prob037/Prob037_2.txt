Certainly! Below is an example of an RTL design for the `TopModule` in Verilog. This module implements a counter that counts from 0 to 999 in a synchronized manner to a 1000-cycle period.

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg [9:0] q // 10 bits to count up to 999
);

    // Internal register for counting
    reg [9:0] count;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 10'b0; // Reset the counter to 0
        end else if (count < 10'd999) begin
            count <= count + 1; // Increment the counter
        end else begin
            count <= 10'b0; // Reset the counter back to 0 after reaching 999
        end
    end

    assign q = count; // Output the count value

endmodule
```

### Explanation
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` takes `clk`, `reset` as inputs and outputs a 10-bit signal `q`.

2. **Internal Counter**: 
   - We define a 10-bit register `count` to track our value.
   - The maximum count will be `999`, which fits within 10 bits.

3. **Always Block**: 
   - The always block triggers on the positive edge of the clock.
   - If a reset is detected (i.e., `reset` is high), the counter is set back to `0`.
   - Otherwise, the counter increments by `1` if itâ€™s less than `999`. When it reaches `999`, it resets back to `0`.

4. **Output Assignment**: The current count value is assigned to `q`.

### Simulation
To ensure correctness, you may want to simulate the module to verify the counting behavior, especially around the boundary conditions of 0 and 999. 

### Usage
In a larger design, you can instantiate this module and connect it to a clock signal and reset signal to use it as a counter.
