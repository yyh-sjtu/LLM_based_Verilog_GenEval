Here is the RTL code for the TopModule with the specified interface and functionality:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [9:0] q
);

reg [9:0] counter;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        counter <= 0;
    end else begin
        if (counter == 999) begin
            counter <= 0;
        end else begin
            counter <= counter + 1;
        end
    end
end

assign q = counter;

endmodule
```

This code implements a 10-bit counter that counts from 0 to 999 with a period of 1000 cycles. The counter is reset to 0 when the reset input is active high. The sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.
