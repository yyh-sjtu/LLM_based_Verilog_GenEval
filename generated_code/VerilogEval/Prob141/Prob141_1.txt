To implement the TopModule with the desired functionality, let's start by designing the counter logic for hours, minutes, and seconds using BCD encoding. We need to account for resetting the clock to "12:00 AM" when the reset signal is asserted.

Here's a high-level description of the required functionality:
- Create separate counters for hours, minutes, and seconds in BCD format.
- Implement the logic to update the counters on each pulse of the enable signal when ena is high.
- Ensure that the clock resets to "12:00 AM" when the reset signal is asserted, with reset taking higher priority than enable.
- Include logic to determine whether the clock is in AM or PM based on the hour count.

Once we have the detailed logic for the counters and state transitions, we can proceed with RTL design and verification to ensure the module functions correctly as per the specified requirements.

Let me know if you have any specific requirements or constraints that need to be considered while designing the RTL for the TopModule.
