Certainly! I'll provide you with a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` based on the Karnaugh map you provided.

### Karnaugh Map Interpretation

Let's analyze the information from the Karnaugh map:

| bc \ a | 0   | 1   |
|--------|-----|-----|
| 00     | 0   | 1   |
| 01     | 1   | 1   |
| 11     | 1   | 1   |
| 10     | 1   | 1   |

From the table above, we can deduce the following logic:

1. **a = 1**: The output `out` is `1` when:
   - (b, c) = (0, 0)
   - (b, c) = (0, 1)
   - (b, c) = (1, 0)
   - (b, c) = (1, 1)

   This means `(b = 0 and c = 1)` and `(b = 1 and c = 0)` should be `1`, regardless of `a`, when `a = 1`.

2. **a = 0**: The output `out` is `1`:
   - (b, c) = (0, 1)
   - (b, c) = (1, 0)
   - (b, c) = (1, 1)

From the analysis, we see that the output is `1` for almost all combinations except when `a = 0` and `b = 0` and `c = 0`.

### Minimal SOP Expression
From the above analysis, the simplified output can be expressed as:
- `out = (c and a) or (b and not c and a) or (not b and c and a) or (b and c) or (not a and b and c)`

### Verilog Code
Here is a simple RTL code for the `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire c,
    output wire out
);

    assign out = (a & (b | c)) | (b & c) | (~a & (b | c));

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code
- The module has three inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`) and one output (`out`).
- The output `out` is generated based on the combinational logic derived from the K-map.
- The `assign` statement gives the simplified logic expression in terms of logical operations.

This implementation captures the behavior specified by the Karnaugh map effectively. If you have any further requirements or modifications, feel free to ask!
