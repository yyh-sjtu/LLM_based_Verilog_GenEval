To implement the `TopModule` as described, we'll analyze the given Karnaugh map and derive the logic from it. The Karnaugh map you provided is as follows:

```
      a
   bc   0     1
   ----------------
   00 | 0 |  1 |  (b'c') a'
   01 | 1 |  1 |  (b'c) a'
   11 | 1 |  1 |  (bc) a
   10 | 1 |  1 |  (bc') a
```

From the Karnaugh map, we can see the following minterms where `out` equals `1`:

- For `bc = 01`: `a = 0 or 1` → covers minterm `01` (1,0)
- For `bc = 11`: `a = 0 or 1` → covers minterm `11` (1, 1)
- For `bc = 10`: `a = 0 or 1` → covers minterm `10` (0, 1)
- For `bc = 00`: `a = 1` → covers minterm `00` (0, 0) -> this case is where out = 0

From this analysis, the simplified logical expression for `out` will be:

\[
out = (b'c) + (bc) + (bc')
\]

This can be simplified to:

\[
out = (b \oplus c)'
\]

Now we can implement the `TopModule` using Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire c,
    output wire out
);

    assign out = (b & c) | (b & ~c) | (~b & c);

endmodule
```

In this design:

- `out` gets computed based on the logical combination of inputs `b` and `c`, ignoring the value of `a`, as all combinations leading to `out = 1` do not depend on `a` when `b` and `c` are true.

Make sure to simulate this module to verify that it behaves as expected.
