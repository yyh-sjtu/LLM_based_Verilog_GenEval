To implement the `TopModule` based on the provided Karnaugh map, let's first interpret the map to determine the logical expression it represents.

### Karnaugh Map Interpretation:
Given the Karnaugh map:

```
          a
   bc   0   1
   00 | 0 | 1 |
   01 | 1 | 1 |
   11 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 1 | 1 |
```

From the map, we can note the following:
- In the row where \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \) (i.e., \( bc = 00 \)), the output is 0 (i.e., \( \overline{a} \overline{b} \overline{c} \)).
- In the row where \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 1 \) (i.e., \( bc = 01 \)), the output is 1, corresponding to \( \overline{b} c \) or \( \overline{b} a \).
- In the row where \( b = 1 \) and \( c = 1 \) (i.e., \( bc = 11 \)), the output is 1. This corresponds to \( b c \).
- In the row where \( b = 1 \) and \( c = 0 \) (i.e., \( bc = 10 \)), the output is 1.

### Simplification:
By analyzing the map, we can derive the simplified expression for the output `out`:
- `out = (b'N) + (b'C) + (BC)`, where:
  - \( b'c \) (1 when \( b = 0, c = 1 \))
  - \( bc \) (1 when \( b = 1, c = 1 \))
  - \( bc' \) (1 when \( b = 1, c = 0 \))

Thus, we can formulate the output as:

```plaintext
out = b'c + ab + ac
```

### RTL Code:
Hereâ€™s how to implement the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire c,
    output wire out
);

assign out = (b & ~c) | (b & c) | (~b & c); // out = b'c + bc + ac

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- We use the `assign` statement to describe combinational logic based on the derived equation.
- Each term corresponds to a condition outlined, and the final output `out` uses bitwise operators for logical operations:
  - `&` for AND
  - `|` for OR
  - `~` for NOT

This implementation accurately follows the specifications from the Karnaugh map. You can compile and simulate this module in an RTL simulator to verify its functionality.
