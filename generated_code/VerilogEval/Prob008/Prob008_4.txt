Sure, here is the RTL code for the TopModule module as per your requirements:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input in,
    output reg out
);

always @(*)
begin
    out = in;
end

endmodule
```

This module will simply assign the value of the input port 'in' to the output port 'out' combinationaly. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
