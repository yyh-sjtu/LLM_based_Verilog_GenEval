Certainly! Below is an example of a simple RTL design for a `TopModule` in Verilog that meets your requirements. The module has a single input port named `in` and a single output port named `out`, and it assigns the output port to the same value as the input port in a combinational manner.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in,   // 1-bit input
    output wire out  // 1-bit output
);

// Combinational assignment
assign out = in;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**:
   - `module TopModule (...)`: This line declares the module with the name `TopModule`.
   
2. **Ports**:
   - `input wire in`: Defines a 1-bit input port named `in`.
   - `output wire out`: Defines a 1-bit output port named `out`.

3. **Combinational Logic**:
   - `assign out = in;`: This line assigns the value of `in` to `out`, establishing the combinational relationship. As soon as the value of `in` changes, `out` will also reflect that change immediately.

4. **End Module**:
   - `endmodule`: Indicates the end of the module definition.

### Usage
To use this module in a larger design, you would instantiate it within another module or testbench. Make sure to handle synthesizable logic, as this design is straightforward and efficient for hardware implementation.
