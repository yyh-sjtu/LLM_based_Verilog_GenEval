To implement the TopModule with the specified interface and functionality, the following Verilog code snippet can be used:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input data,
    output reg [3:0] count,
    output reg counting,
    output reg done,
    input ack
);

parameter IDLE = 2'b00;
parameter DETECT_PATTERN = 2'b01;
parameter SHIFT_IN_DELAY = 2'b10;
parameter COUNTING = 2'b11;

reg [1:0] state;
reg [3:0] delay;
reg [3:0] remaining_time;

always @ (posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= IDLE;
        count <= 4'b0000;
        counting <= 0;
        done <= 0;
        delay <= 4'b0000;
        remaining_time <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        case (state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (data == 1 && $rose(data)) begin
                    state <= DETECT_PATTERN;
                end
            end
            DETECT_PATTERN: begin
                // Shift in delay
                delay <= {delay[2:0], data};
                state <= SHIFT_IN_DELAY;
            end
            SHIFT_IN_DELAY: begin
                state <= COUNTING;
                counting <= 1;
                remaining_time <= delay;
            end
            COUNTING: begin
                if (remaining_time == 0) begin
                    counting <= 0;
                    done <= 1;
                    if (ack) begin
                        state <= IDLE;
                        count <= 4'bxxxx; // don't care value
                        done <= 0;
                    end
                end else begin
                    remaining_time <= remaining_time - 1;
                end
            end
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code snippet defines a module named TopModule with the specified interface and implements the timer functionality as described in the requirements. The state machine transitions between different states based on the input data and controls the timer counting and notification behavior accordingly. The module resets to the IDLE state when the reset signal is asserted.

As a professional RTL designer, I would simulate and verify this design thoroughly to ensure its correctness and functionality before moving on to synthesis and implementation. This includes checking for proper state transitions, input pattern detection, delay shifting, counting behavior, and proper notification and acknowledgment handling. Testing different scenarios and edge cases is essential to ensure the robustness of the design.
