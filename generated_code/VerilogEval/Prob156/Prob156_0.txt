As an RTL designer, I would start by defining the state machine for the TopModule with states for searching for the input pattern, reading the delay value, counting, and waiting for acknowledgment. I would then create the necessary logic to detect the input pattern, shift in the delay value, count for the specified duration, and handle the acknowledgment process.

I would also implement the necessary counter logic to keep track of the remaining time and update the count output accordingly. Additionally, I would design the circuit to assert the counting output when the timer is active and the done output when the timer has timed out.

I would ensure that the reset signal properly resets the circuit to the initial state where it searches for the input pattern. All sequential logic would be triggered on the positive edge of the clock to maintain proper synchronization.

Overall, I would carefully design and implement the TopModule to meet the specified requirements for the timer functionality while ensuring proper functionality, timing, and synchronization in the RTL design.
