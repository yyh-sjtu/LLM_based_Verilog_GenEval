To implement the `TopModule` state machine with one-hot encoding in Verilog, we first need to derive the next state logic and the output logic based on the states and transitions given in your problem description. Let's break it down.

### States Definition
We have defined the states as follows:

- S0: state[0]
- S1: state[1]
- S2: state[2]
- S3: state[3]
- S4: state[4]
- S5: state[5]
- S6: state[6]
- S7: state[7]
- S8: state[8]
- S9: state[9]

### Next State Logic
Using the provided state transitions, we can create the logic for `next_state` based on the current state's encoding and the input signal `in`. The transitions for each state based on the value of `in` are:

- If in = 0:
  - S0 → S0
  - S1 → S0
  - S2 → S0
  - S3 → S0
  - S4 → S0
  - S5 → S8
  - S6 → S9
  - S7 → S0
  - S8 → S0
  - S9 → S0
- If in = 1:
  - S0 → S1
  - S1 → S2
  - S2 → S3
  - S3 → S4
  - S4 → S5
  - S5 → S6
  - S6 → S7
  - S7 → S7
  - S8 → S1
  - S9 → S1

### Output Logic
The outputs (`out1`, `out2`) are defined as follows (only non-zero values are noted):

- S7 → (0, 1)
- S8 → (1, 0)
- S9 → (1, 1)

### Verilog Implementation
Now, we can encode this into a Verilog module. Here’s the implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire in,
    input wire [9:0] state,
    output reg [9:0] next_state,
    output reg out1,
    output reg out2
);

// Next state logic
always @(*) begin
    // Default next_state and outputs
    next_state = 10'b0000000000; 
    out1 = 0;
    out2 = 0;
    
    case (1'b1) // This will check which state is currently active
        state[0]: begin // S0
            next_state[0] = (in == 0) ? 1 : 0; // S0 when in=0, S1 when in=1
            next_state[1] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; 
        end
        state[1]: begin // S1
            next_state[0] = 1; // S0
            next_state[2] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; // S2 
        end
        state[2]: begin // S2
            next_state[0] = 1; // S0
            next_state[3] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; // S3 
        end
        state[3]: begin // S3
            next_state[0] = 1; // S0
            next_state[4] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; // S4 
        end
        state[4]: begin // S4
            next_state[0] = 1; // S0
            next_state[5] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; // S5 
        end
        state[5]: begin // S5
            next_state[8] = 1; // S8 when in = 0
            next_state[6] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; // S6 
        end
        state[6]: begin // S6
            next_state[9] = 1; // S9 when in = 0
            next_state[7] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; // S7 
        end
        state[7]: begin // S7
            next_state[0] = 1; // S0
            // Stay in S7 when in = 1
            out2 = 1; // Set output: (0, 1) 
        end
        state[8]: begin // S8
            next_state[0] = 1; // S0
            next_state[1] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; // S1
            out1 = 1; // Set output: (1, 0)
        end
        state[9]: begin // S9
            next_state[0] = 1; // S0
            next_state[1] = (in == 1) ? 1 : 0; // S1
            out1 = 1; // Set output: (1, 1)
            out2 = 1;
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation
In this implementation:

1. `always @(*)` block is used to create combinational logic for `next_state` and outputs.
2. A `case (1'b1)` is used to detect the active state by checking which bit in `state` is high (one-hot encoded).
3. The `next_state` is set based on the `in` input value.
4. Outputs `out1` and `out2` are assigned directly based on the current state.

This design captures the behavior of the specified state machine with the requirements you've set. You may compile this code in an RTL synthesis tool as part of your FPGA or ASIC design process.
