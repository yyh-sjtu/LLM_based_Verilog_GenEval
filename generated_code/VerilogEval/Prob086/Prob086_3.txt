As a professional RTL designer, I will create the Verilog code for the TopModule implementing the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, with an active-high synchronous reset.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [4:0] q
);

reg [4:0] lfsr;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        lfsr <= 5'b1; // Reset LFSR output to 1
    end else begin
        lfsr <= {lfsr[3] ^ lfsr[4], lfsr[0], lfsr[1], lfsr[2], lfsr[3]};
    end
end

assign q = lfsr;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code creates the TopModule with the specified interface and implements the 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR is reset to 1 when the reset signal is asserted and shifts according to the Galois LFSR algorithm on each clock cycle.
