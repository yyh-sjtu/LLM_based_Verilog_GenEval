As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule as described below in Verilog HDL:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [4:0] q
);

reg [4:0] lfsr_state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        lfsr_state <= 5'b1;
    end else begin
        lfsr_state <= {lfsr_state[3] ^ lfsr_state[4], lfsr_state[4:1]};
    end
end

assign q = lfsr_state;

endmodule
```

This Verilog code implements a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The lfsr_state variable holds the current state of the LFSR, and on each positive edge of the clock, the next state is calculated based on the tap positions (3 and 5) using the XOR gates. The reset signal is used to initialize the LFSR output to 1.

I believe this implementation meets the requirements for the TopModule as specified. If you have any further questions or need modifications, feel free to let me know.
