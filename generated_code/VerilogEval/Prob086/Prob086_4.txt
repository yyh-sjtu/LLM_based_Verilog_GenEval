Here is the verilog code for implementing the TopModule module with the specified interface and functionality:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [4:0] q
);

reg [4:0] lfsr_state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        lfsr_state <= 5'b1;
    end else begin
        lfsr_state <= {lfsr_state[3] ^ lfsr_state[4], lfsr_state[4:1]};
    end
end

assign q = lfsr_state;

endmodule
```

This code defines a TopModule module with a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR that cycles through 31 states before repeating. The LFSR has taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The output q is assigned with the current state of the LFSR. The LFSR is reset to 1 on the positive edge of the clock when the reset signal is high.

Please let me know if you need any further clarification or assistance.
