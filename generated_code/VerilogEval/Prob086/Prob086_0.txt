To implement a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3, we'll structure the module `TopModule` as described. The LFSR will shift its bits serially based on the XOR operation applied to the tapped bits. The following Verilog code represents the specified behavior:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [4:0] q
);

    // XOR positions based on taps (5 and 3)
    wire feedback;
    
    // Calculate feedback as XOR of tapped bits
    assign feedback = q[4] ^ q[2]; // Taps at position 5 (q[4]) and position 3 (q[2])

    // On the rising edge of the clock
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            // Synchronous reset to 1
            q <= 5'b00001; // Reset to a non-zero state (1)
        end else begin
            // Shift left and insert feedback
            q <= {q[3:0], feedback}; // Shift register with feedback
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Module Definition**: The `TopModule` is defined with inputs `clk` (clock) and `reset`, and a 5-bit output `q`.

2. **Feedback Calculation**: The `feedback` wire is defined as the XOR of the bits in the 5th and 3rd positions (`q[4]` and `q[2]`), which are the tapped positions.

3. **Always Block**: The sequential logic is defined inside an `always` block that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock. It also responds to the `reset` signal:
   - If `reset` is high, `q` is initialized to `5'b00001` (which is a non-zero state).
   - If `reset` is not active, `q` is updated with the new value, shifting the current bits left and inserting the `feedback`.

4. **State Transition**: On each clock cycle, the state of the LFSR updates according to the defined shifting and feedback structure, ensuring the LFSR exhibits maximum-length behavior.

### Testing and Simulation:
To verify the functionality of the LFSR, further testing would need to be implemented using a testbench to check the cycling through states and ensure no state is inadvertently zeroed out during operation.
