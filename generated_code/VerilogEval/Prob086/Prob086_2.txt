As a professional RTL designer, I will implement the TopModule module with the specified interface and functionality. Here is the Verilog code for the module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [4:0] q
);

reg [4:0] lfsr;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        lfsr <= 5'd1; // Reset LFSR output to 1
    end else begin
        lfsr <= {lfsr[3] ^ lfsr[2], lfsr[4:1]}; // LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3
    end
end

assign q = lfsr;

endmodule
```

This implementation creates a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit positions 5 and 3. The LFSR output is reset to 1 on an active-high synchronous reset signal. The sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal.

Please let me know if you need any further modifications or have any additional requirements.
