Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation of a half adder module named `TopModule`. The module takes two 1-bit input signals, `a` and `b`, and produces a 1-bit sum output (`sum`) and a 1-bit carry-out output (`cout`). 

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,      // First input bit
    input  wire b,      // Second input bit
    output wire sum,    // Sum output
    output wire cout    // Carry-out output
);

// The sum is the XOR of the two inputs
assign sum = a ^ b;

// The carry-out is the AND of the two inputs
assign cout = a & b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation

- **Inputs**: `a` and `b` are both 1-bit input signals.
- **Outputs**: 
  - `sum` is produced by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b` (`sum = a ^ b`).
  - `cout` is produced by performing a bitwise AND operation between `a` and `b` (`cout = a & b`).
  
This implementation adheres to the definition of a half adder, which produces a sum and carry-out for the addition of two single bits.
