Here is a Verilog code implementation of the TopModule module as a half adder:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    output sum,
    output cout
);

assign sum = a ^ b; // XOR operation for sum output
assign cout = a & b; // AND operation for carry-out output

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines the TopModule module with the specified input and output ports, and implements a half adder logic to calculate the sum and carry-out based on the input bits 'a' and 'b'. The sum is calculated using XOR operation and the carry-out is calculated using AND operation.
