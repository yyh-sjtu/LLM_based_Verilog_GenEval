Sure, here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing a half adder:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    output sum,
    output cout
);

assign sum = a ^ b; // XOR operation for sum
assign cout = a & b; // AND operation for carry-out

endmodule
```

This module takes two input bits `a` and `b`, performs an XOR operation to get the sum, and an AND operation to get the carry-out. This implementation satisfies the requirements for a half adder module. Let me know if you need any further modifications or assistance.
