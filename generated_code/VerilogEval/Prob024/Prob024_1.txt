Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a half adder in Verilog for the `TopModule` you described. This module takes two 1-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) and produces a 1-bit sum output as well as a 1-bit carry-out output.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,       // First input bit
    input wire b,       // Second input bit
    output wire sum,    // Output sum
    output wire cout    // Output carry-out
);

// Logic for half adder
assign sum = a ^ b;   // Sum is the XOR of a and b
assign cout = a & b;  // Carry-out is the AND of a and b

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `a` and `b`: These are the two input bits which we want to add.

2. **Outputs**:
   - `sum`: This is the output that represents the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - `cout`: This represents the carry-out resulting from the addition.

3. **Logic**:
   - The sum is obtained by performing an XOR operation (`^`) on `a` and `b`.
   - The carry-out is obtained by performing an AND operation (`&`) on `a` and `b`.

### Simulation Example:
If you want to simulate or test this module, you might use a testbench like this:

```verilog
module tb_TopModule; // Testbench for TopModule
    reg a;           // Test input a
    reg b;           // Test input b
    wire sum;       // Wire to observe sum output
    wire cout;      // Wire to observe carry-out output

    // Instantiate the TopModule
    TopModule uut (
        .a(a),
        .b(b),
        .sum(sum),
        .cout(cout)
    );

    initial begin
        // Test cases
        $monitor("a=%b, b=%b -> sum=%b, cout=%b", a, b, sum, cout);
        
        // Test case 1
        a = 0; b = 0; #10;
        
        // Test case 2
        a = 0; b = 1; #10;
        
        // Test case 3
        a = 1; b = 0; #10;
        
        // Test case 4
        a = 1; b = 1; #10;

        // Finish simulation
        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```

### Notes:
- The testbench initializes the inputs, instantiates the `TopModule`, and prints the results for various combinations of `a` and `b`.
- You can simulate this with a Verilog simulator to see how the half adder behaves. Adjust the timing (`#10`) as per your requirements. 

You now have a complete implementation of your half adder! If you have any specific requirements or modifications, feel free to ask!
