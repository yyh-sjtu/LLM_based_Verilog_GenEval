Sure! A half adder takes two input bits, `a` and `b`, and produces two outputs: `sum` and `carry-out` (often labeled `cout`). The `sum` will be the XOR of the two bits, and the `cout` will be the AND of the two bits.

Here's a simple Verilog implementation for the `TopModule` that fulfills your requirements for a half adder:

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,      // Input bit a
    input  wire b,      // Input bit b
    output wire sum,    // Output sum
    output wire cout    // Output carry-out
);

// Calculate sum and carry-out for a half adder
assign sum = a ^ b;     // Sum is the XOR of a and b
assign cout = a & b;    // Carry-out is the AND of a and b

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- `sum` is computed using the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between `a` and `b`.
- `cout` is computed using the bitwise AND operation (`&`) between `a` and `b`.

### Usage
You can instantiate the `TopModule` in a testbench or another module by connecting `a` and `b` inputs, and observing the outputs `sum` and `cout`.
