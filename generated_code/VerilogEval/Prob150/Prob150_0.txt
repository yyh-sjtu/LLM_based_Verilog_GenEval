To implement the `TopModule` with the given specifications, we will derive equations for the next states and outputs by observing the state machine behavior as described.

### Moore State Machine Overview
1. **State Encoding**: 
   - S    = 10'b0000000001  
   - S1   = 10'b0000000010  
   - S11  = 10'b0000000100  
   - S110 = 10'b0000001000  
   - B0   = 10'b0000010000  
   - B1   = 10'b0000100000  
   - B2   = 10'b0001000000  
   - B3   = 10'b0010000000  
   - Count = 10'b0100000000  
   - Wait  = 10'b1000000000  
   
### Next-State Logic Equations

We'll derive the logic for `B3_next`, `S_next`, `S1_next`, `Count_next`, `Wait_next`.

1. **B3_next**:
   - B3 -> B3 (stay in B3) when `shift_ena` = 1.
   - B3 -> Count when `shift_ena` = 1.
   - `B3_next = B3 & shift_ena`

2. **S_next**:
   - S -> S when `d`=0.
   - S -> S1 when `d`=1.
   - `S_next = S & ~d | S1 & d`

3. **S1_next**:
   - S1 -> S when `d`=0.
   - S1 -> S11 when `d`=1.
   - `S1_next = S1 & ~d | S11 & d`

4. **Count_next**:
   - Count -> Count when `counting`=1 and `done_counting`=0.
   - Count -> Wait when `counting`=1 and `done_counting`=1.
   - `Count_next = Count & counting & ~done_counting | Wait & done_counting`

5. **Wait_next**:
   - Wait -> Wait when `done`=1 and `ack`=0.
   - Wait -> S when `done`=1 and `ack`=1.
   - `Wait_next = Wait & done & ~ack | S & done & ack`

### Output Logic Equations

Now we derive the output signals based on the current state:

1. **done**:
   - Done = 1 when in `Wait` state.
   - `done = Wait`

2. **counting**:
   - Counting = 1 when in `Count` state.
   - `counting = Count`

3. **shift_ena**:
   - Shift enable = 1 when in any state from `B0` to `B3`.
   - `shift_ena = B0 | B1 | B2 | B3`

### Verilog Implementation
Hereâ€™s how we can implement the derived equations in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input d,
    input done_counting,
    input ack,
    input [9:0] state,
    output B3_next,
    output S_next,
    output S1_next,
    output Count_next,
    output Wait_next,
    output done,
    output counting,
    output shift_ena
);
    // Next state logic
    assign B3_next = state[8] & 1; // B3 stays in B3
    assign S_next = state[0] & ~d | state[1] & d; // S transition
    assign S1_next = state[1] & ~d | state[2] & d; // S1 transition
    assign Count_next = state[9] & 1 & ~done_counting | 1 & done_counting; // Count transition
    assign Wait_next = state[9] & 1 & ~ack | state[0] & 1 & ack; // Wait transition

    // Output logic
    assign done = state[9]; // done is high when in Wait state
    assign counting = state[9]; // counting is high when in Count state
    assign shift_ena = state[4] | state[5] | state[6] | state[7]; // shift enable when in B0 to B3 states

endmodule
```

### Explanation
- Each output and next state is derived according to the state transitions and outputs defined in the state machine description.
- The `while` logic in Verilog is used to define how the outputs and next states will respond to each state and input condition.
- Ensure the correct ports are wired when integrating this module in a larger design.
