To implement the described Moore state machine in RTL (Register Transfer Level), we will define the `TopModule` following your requirements. Here we will derive the next-state logic and output logic based on the state transitions provided.

### State Encoding

Using one-hot encoding, our states will be represented as follows:

- S     = 10'b0000000001
- S1    = 10'b0000000010
- S11   = 10'b0000000100
- S110  = 10'b0000001000
- B0    = 10'b0000010000
- B1    = 10'b0000100000
- B2    = 10'b0001000000
- B3    = 10'b0010000000
- Count  = 10'b0100000000
- Wait   = 10'b1000000000

### Next-State Logic
Let's derive the next-state logic equations for each state based on the transitions specified.

1. **State S (10'b0000000001)**
   - If d = 0: Stay in S
   - If d = 1: Go to S1
   - Next-State: `S_next = S & ~d | S1 & d`

2. **State S1 (10'b0000000010)**
   - If d = 0: Back to S
   - If d = 1: Go to S11
   - Next-State: `S1_next = S1 & ~d | S11 & d`

3. **State S11 (10'b0000000100)**
   - If d = 0: Go to S110
   - If d = 1: Stay in S11 
   - Next-State: `S11_next = S11 & d | S110 & ~d`

4. **State S110 (10'b0000001000)**
   - If d = 0: Go to S
   - If d = 1: Go to B0
   - Next-State: `Count_next = S110 & ~d | B0 & d`

5. **State B0 (10'b0000010000)**
   - Always transition to B1
   - Next-State: `B1_next = B0`

6. **State B1 (10'b0000100000)**
   - Always transition to B2
   - Next-State: `B2_next = B1`

7. **State B2 (10'b0001000000)**
   - Always transition to B3
   - Next-State: `B3_next = B2`

8. **State B3 (10'b0010000000)**
   - Always transition to Count
   - Next-State: `Count_next = B3`

9. **State Count (10'b0100000000)**
   - Transition to Count if counting is 1 and done_counting is not asserted
   - Transition to Wait if done_counting is asserted
   - `Count_next = Count & counting & ~done_counting | Wait & done_counting`

10. **State Wait (10'b1000000000)**
    - Stay in Wait if done is asserted and ack is 0
    - Transition to S if done is asserted and ack is 1
    - `Wait_next = Wait & done & ~ack | S & (done & ack)`

### Output Logic
Next, we derive the outputs based on the states:

- **done**: High when in Wait and done is asserted: 
  ```verilog
  done = Wait & done
  ```

- **counting**: High when in Count:
  ```verilog
  counting = Count
  ```

- **shift_ena**: High when in B0, B1, B2, B3:
  ```verilog
  shift_ena = B0 | B1 | B2 | B3
  ```

### RTL Code Implementation

Based on the logic derived, hereâ€™s a Verilog example of how to implement the module `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  d,
    input  done_counting,
    input  ack,
    input  [9:0] state,
    output reg B3_next,
    output reg S_next,
    output reg S1_next,
    output reg Count_next,
    output reg Wait_next,
    output reg done,
    output reg counting,
    output reg shift_ena
);

always @* begin
    // Initialize outputs
    B3_next = 1'b0;
    S_next = 1'b0;
    S1_next = 1'b0;
    Count_next = 1'b0;
    Wait_next = 1'b0;
    done = 1'b0;
    counting = 1'b0;
    shift_ena = 1'b0;

    // Next state logic
    // State S
    if (state[0]) begin
        S_next = ~d;
        S1_next = d;
    end
    // State S1
    else if (state[1]) begin
        S_next = ~d;
        S1_next = ~d;
        // S11 next state will be handled next
    end
    // State S11
    else if (state[2]) begin
        S11_next = (d) ? state[2] : 1'b0; // Stay or go to S110
    end
    // State S110
    else if (state[3]) begin
        S_next = ~d;
        Count_next = d;
    end
    // State B0
    else if (state[4]) begin
        B3_next = 1'b1; // Always go to B1
    end
    // State B1, B2, B3
    else if (state[5] | state[6] | state[7]) begin
        Count_next = 1'b1; // Always next to count
    end
    // State Count
    else if (state[8]) begin
        Count_next = 1'b1;
        Wait_next = done_counting;
        counting = 1'b1;
    end
    // State Wait
    else if (state[9]) begin
        Wait_next = 1'b1;
        if (ack) S_next = 1'b1; // Transition back to S
    end

    // Output logic
    done = state[9]; // done when in Wait and done=1
    counting = state[8]; // counting when in Count state
    shift_ena = state[4] | state[5] | state[6] | state[7]; // shift enabled in B0, B1, B2, B3
end

endmodule
```

This module describes the combinational logic of the Moore state machine as requested. Make sure to hook up this logic to a clock or another control system in your larger design, as this snippet does not include clocked behavior (which would typically involve state registers).
