Hereâ€™s a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that models Rule 90 cellular automaton with a 512-bit wide input and output. The module uses sequential logic to update the state of the system based on the specified rules, loading new data when the `load` signal is asserted.

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire load,
    input wire [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    // Intermediate array to hold the next state
    reg [511:0] next_q;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the input data into q
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            // Apply Rule 90 logic
            next_q[0] = 1'b0; // q[-1] is considered 0
            for (integer i = 1; i < 511; i = i + 1) begin
                next_q[i] = q[i-1] ^ q[i+1]; // XOR of left and right neighbors
            end
            next_q[511] = 1'b0; // q[512] is considered 0

            // Update q with the newly calculated next_q
            q <= next_q;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **Module Declaration**: We define the module `TopModule` with its input and output ports.

2. **State Variables**:
   - `q`: The output state representing the current state of the cellular automaton.
   - `next_q`: An internal register array used to compute the next state based on the current state `q`.

3. **Always Block**:
   - This block is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal.
   - If `load` is asserted (`1`), we load the incoming data (`data`) directly into `q`.
   - If `load` is not asserted, we compute the next state using Rule 90 as follows:
     - The first cell assumes a left neighbor of `0` (hence `next_q[0]` is set to `0`).
     - We iterate through the bits from `1` to `510`, applying the XOR operation between the left neighbor (`q[i-1]`) and the right neighbor (`q[i+1]`) to generate the new state for cell `i`.
     - Finally, the last cell assumes a right neighbor of `0` (hence `next_q[511]` is set to `0`).

4. **State Update**: At the end of the always block, we update the state `q` with `next_q`, which represents the state after one clock cycle.

### Simulation and Testing

To test the functionality of this module, you'd typically write a testbench that provides stimuli and checks whether the output behaves as expected according to Rule 90 over multiple clock cycles.

Feel free to integrate this module into a larger design or modify it as needed for your specific requirements!
