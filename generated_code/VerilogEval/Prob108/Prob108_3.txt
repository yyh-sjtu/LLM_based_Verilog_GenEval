To implement the TopModule with Rule 90 cellular automaton, we will first create a shift register to store the current state of the 512-cell system. Each cell will be represented by a bit. We will then implement the logic to compute the next state of each cell based on the Rule 90 rules.

Here is the Verilog code for TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

reg [511:0] next_state;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data;
    end else begin
        next_state[0] = q[1] ^ q[0] ^ 0; // Rule 90 for the first cell
        next_state[511] = q[510] ^ q[511] ^ 0; // Rule 90 for the last cell
        for (int i = 1; i < 511; i = i + 1) begin
            next_state[i] = q[i-1] ^ q[i] ^ q[i+1]; // Rule 90 for the rest of the cells
        end
        q <= next_state;
    end
end

endmodule
```

In this code, we initialize the `next_state` register to store the next state of the 512-cell system. When `load` is high, we load the initial state from `data` into the `q` register. Otherwise, we implement the Rule 90 logic to compute the next state of each cell based on its neighbors. The boundaries are assumed to be zero.

You can simulate this module to verify that it behaves according to the Rule 90 cellular automaton rules. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.
