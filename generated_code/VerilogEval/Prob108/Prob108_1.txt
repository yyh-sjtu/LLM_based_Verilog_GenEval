Here's a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that represents a 512-cell system for Rule 90 in a one-dimensional cellular automaton. This module handles the given requirements, including loading the initial state, processing the Rule 90 transition on each clock cycle, and outputting the current state.

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input clk,
    input load,
    input [511:0] data,
    output reg [511:0] q
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load the initial state
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            // Apply Rule 90 to advance the state
            reg [511:0] next_q; // Temporary storage for the next state
            integer i;
            for (i = 0; i < 512; i = i + 1) begin
                // Use boundary conditions: q[-1] = 0 (left-most), q[512] = 0 (right-most)
                next_q[i] = (i > 0 ? q[i-1] : 1'b0) ^ (i < 511 ? q[i+1] : 1'b0);
            end
            q <= next_q; // Update state to next state
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Interface**: The `TopModule` has been defined with the necessary inputs and outputs including the clock (`clk`), load signal (`load`), input data (`data`), and output state (`q`).

2. **Initial Load Condition**: We check if the `load` signal is high. If true, we load the input `data` into the current state `q`.

3. **Rule 90 Implementation**:
   - We create a temporary register `next_q` to hold the next state of the cells.
   - We iterate through each cell from 0 to 511.
   - For each cell, we calculate the next state based on its neighbors. The conditions respect the boundary conditions (where `q[-1]` and `q[512]` are considered as zero).
   - The new state for each cell is computed using the XOR of the left neighbor (`q[i-1]` if `i > 0`, otherwise 0) and the right neighbor (`q[i+1]` if `i < 511`, otherwise 0).

4. **Updating the State**: After calculating the next states for all cells, we update `q` with `next_q`.

### Notes:
- All sequential logic is synchronized with the positive edge of the clock using the `@(posedge clk)` statement.
- The boundaries are considered correctly to ensure that the cells at both ends take the assumed state of 0 when computing the next state.
- The design adheres to your specified interface with all inputs and outputs defined correctly.

This design efficiently implements Rule 90 for the one-dimensional cellular automaton on a 512-bit system.
