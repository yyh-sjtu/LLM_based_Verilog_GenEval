As a professional RTL designer, I would first analyze the given simulation waveforms to understand the behavior of the module named TopModule. Based on the provided input and output values at different time intervals, it appears that the circuit is performing a specific logical operation on the inputs a, b, c, and d to generate the output q.

After analyzing the waveforms, I can infer that the logical operation being performed by the module is as follows:

q = (a AND b AND c) OR (NOT d)

Based on this logical operation, I will now implement the TopModule module in RTL (Register Transfer Level) code as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule(
  input a, b, c, d,
  output q
);

assign q = (a & b & c) | (~d);

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines the TopModule module with the specified input and output ports and implements the logic described by the given simulation waveforms. The module takes inputs a, b, c, and d, performs the logical operation (a & b & c) | (~d), and assigns the result to the output port q.

By implementing this RTL code, the TopModule module should correctly replicate the behavior observed in the provided simulation waveforms.
