Based on the simulation waveforms you provided, we will decode the behavior of the module `TopModule`. The key is to analyze the input-output relationship from the provided time and signal values.

### Analyzing the Output

From the simulation data, the corresponding outputs (`q`) based on inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) at different times can be summarized as follows:

```
Time(ns)   a   b   c   d   q
0          0   0   0   0   1
20         0   0   0   1   0
25         0   0   1   0   0
30         0   0   1   1   1
35         0   1   0   0   0
40         0   1   0   1   1
45         0   1   1   0   1
50         0   1   1   1   0
55         1   0   0   0   0
60         1   0   0   1   1
65         1   0   1   0   1
70         1   0   1   1   0
75         1   1   0   0   1
80         1   1   0   1   0
85         1   1   1   0   0
90         1   1   1   1   1
```

### Determining the Logic

1. The output `q` follows a pattern based on combinations of inputs.
2. Analyzing each row:
    - When `a` is `0`, for specific combinations of `b`, `c`, and `d`, we have certain outputs (e.g. `q` is `1` at `0`, `30` as shown).
    - When `a` is `1`, other patterns emerge with respect to `b`, `c`, and `d`.

### Simplified Expression

Through further examination, we can discern that:
- `q` is `1` under the following combinations:
    - `b = 1` and `c = 1` and `d = 1` (e.g., when a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1)
    - `b = 0`, `c = 1`, `d = 1`
    - `b = 1` and `d = 1` but `c = 0`.
    - `b = 0` and `d = 0`, and when `c = 1` (e.g. `0 0 1 1`).
    - `b = 1` and `c = 0` but `d = 0`.
    - Unique case for `d=0` while the others are `0` or `1`.

### Verilog Implementation

The final implementation for the combinational logic circuit, in Verilog, would be as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire c,
    input  wire d,
    output wire q
);

    assign q = (b & c & d) |             // Case: a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1
               (!a & !b & !c & !d) |     // Case: a=0, b=0, c=0, d=0
               (!a & d) |                 // Case: a=0, b=0, c=0, d=1
               (b & !c & !d) |            // Case: a=0, b=1, c=0, d=0
               (!a & c & d) |             // Case: a=0, b=0, c=1, d=1
               (a & !b & c & !d) |        // Case: a=1, b=0, c=1, d=0
               (a & b & !c & d);          // Case: a=1, b=1, c=0, d=1

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code
- The logic uses `assign` statements to implement the truth table using logical operations.
- Each condition corresponds to the determined cases from the analysis, combining AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and NOT (`!`) operations. 

This approach gives you a clean and efficient combinational module following the behavior defined by the provided waveform data.
