To implement the `TopModule` with the provided behavior in Verilog, we first need to analyze the simulation waveforms to extract the logic expressions for the output `q` based on the inputs `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Here's a summary of how `q` changes in relation to the inputs:

### Observed Behavior:
1. **When `a=0`:**
   - `b = 0, c = 0, d = 0 => q = 1`
   - `b = 0, c = 0, d = 1 => q = 0`
   - `b = 0, c = 1, d = 0 => q = 0`
   - `b = 0, c = 1, d = 1 => q = 1`
   - `b = 1, c = 0, d = 0 => q = 0`
   - `b = 1, c = 0, d = 1 => q = 1`
   - `b = 1, c = 1, d = 0 => q = 1`
   - `b = 1, c = 1, d = 1 => q = 1`

2. **When `a=1`:**
   - `b = 0, c = 0, d = 0 => q = 0`
   - `b = 0, c = 0, d = 1 => q = 1`
   - `b = 0, c = 1, d = 0 => q = 1`
   - `b = 0, c = 1, d = 1 => q = 0`
   - `b = 1, c = 0, d = 0 => q = 1`
   - `b = 1, c = 0, d = 1 => q = 0`
   - `b = 1, c = 1, d = 0 => q = 0`
   - `b = 1, c = 1, d = 1 => q = 1`

### Constructing the Logic:
From the observations:
- `q` is `1` when `(a == 0 AND ((b==0 AND d==1) OR (b==0 AND c==1) OR (b==1 AND c==1)))`
- `q` is `1` when `(a == 1 AND ((b==0 AND d==1) OR (b==0 AND c==1) OR (b==1 AND d==0)))`
- We notice some patterns that can be simplified.

### Implementation:
Here's a possible implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire q
);
    assign q = ( (a == 0 && ( (b == 0 && d) || (b == 0 && c) || (b && c) ) ) ) ||
                 ( (a == 1 && ( (b == 0 && d) || (b == 0 && c) || (b && ~d) ) ) ) );

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The output `q` is computed using a combination of logic operations based on `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
- The `assign` statement uses logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operations to define the output according to the patterns observed in the waveform table.
- Each condition checks combinations of the input bits to produce the required output.

### Testing:
To verify the functionality, run a testbench that toggles `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in the specified sequences and monitors the output `q`. This module should provide the expected output matching the waveform data described.
