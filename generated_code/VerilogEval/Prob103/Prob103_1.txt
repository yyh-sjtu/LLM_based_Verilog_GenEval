As a professional RTL designer, I would begin by analyzing the given simulation waveforms to determine the behavior of the circuit. Based on the provided input-output pairs, the circuit seems to implement a specific logic function.

After carefully studying the waveforms, I can see that the output q is high (1) when the inputs a, b, and c are all low (0) regardless of the value of input d. When a, b, and c are low and d is high (1), the output q goes low (0). For all other input combinations, the output q toggles between high and low.

Based on this analysis, I would implement the TopModule as follows in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

always @(*) begin
    if(a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 0) begin
        q = 1;
    end else if(a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1 && d == 0) begin
        q = 0;
    end else begin
        q = ~(a & b & c);
    end
end

endmodule
```

This implementation of TopModule in Verilog captures the behavior observed in the simulation waveforms. It checks the input combinations and generates the corresponding output q based on the specified logic conditions. I would then verify this implementation through simulation and functional verification to ensure its correctness.
