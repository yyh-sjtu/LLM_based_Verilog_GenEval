Certainly! Below is an RTL implementation of the `TopModule` that incorporates a Moore-type finite state machine (FSM) to recognize the specified HDLC framing sequences. We will define the states, inputs, outputs, and the FSM transitions.

### Verilog Implementation of TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input       clk,
    input       reset,
    input       in,
    output reg  disc,
    output reg  flag,
    output reg  err
);

// State encoding
typedef enum logic [2:0] {
    IDLE,       // Initial state, after reset or after processing a frame
    ONE,        // Saw one '1'
    TWO,        // Saw two '1's
    THREE,      // Saw three '1's
    FOUR,       // Saw four '1's
    FIVE,       // Saw five '1's
    DISCARD,    // This state means we detected 0111110, need to discard next bit
    FLAG,       // This state means we detected 01111110, a flag is seen
    ERROR       // This state means more than 6 consecutive '1's
} state_t;

state_t current_state, next_state;

// Output logic
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        current_state <= IDLE;
    end else begin
        current_state <= next_state;
    end
end

// Next state logic and output generation
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        disc <= 0;
        flag <= 0;
        err <= 0;

### Explanation:
1. **State Definitions**: Each state corresponds to a part of recognizing the HDLC sequences:
   - `IDLE`: Expecting input & considering previous input as 0.
   - `ONE` to `FIVE`: Counting consecutive '1's.
   - `DISCARD`: A state after detecting the sequence before flag (0111110).
   - `FLAG`: When the complete frame sequence is recognized (01111110).
   - `ERROR`: When detecting 7 or more consecutive '1's.

2. **Synchronous Reset**: On reset, the FSM moves to `IDLE`.

3. **Output Logic**: Outputs `disc`, `flag`, and `err` are asserted only for the cycle following the event.

4. **Next State Logic**: The next state is decided based on the current state and the value of input `in`.

This implementation serves as a fundamental approach to an HDLC framing sequence detector in RTL. You can expand it further based on specific design requirements or optimization needs.
