Here is a sample RTL code implementation for the TopModule as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0000; // Reset the counter to 0
    end else begin
        if (q == 4'b1111) begin
            q <= 4'b0000; // Reset the counter to 0 when it reaches 15
        end else begin
            q <= q + 1; // Increment the counter
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This RTL code defines a module named TopModule with a 4-bit binary counter that counts from 0 to 15 with a period of 16. The counter increments on the positive edge of the clock signal and resets to 0 when the reset signal is active high. The counter output q is a 4-bit output.
