Here is a Verilog code implementation for the TopModule as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @ (posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        q <= q + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module TopModule with input ports for clk and reset, and an output port q which is a 4-bit binary counter. The counter increments by one on each rising edge of the clock signal, unless the reset signal is active high, in which case the counter is reset to 0.
