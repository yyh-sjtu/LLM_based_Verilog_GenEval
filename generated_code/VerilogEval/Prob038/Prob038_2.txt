Certainly! Below is a simple RTL implementation in Verilog for the `TopModule`, which includes a 4-bit binary counter. This counter counts from 0 to 15, resets to 0 upon a high reset signal, and is clocked on the positive edge.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  reset,
    output reg [3:0] q // 4-bit output
);

// Always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock or when reset is high
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        // Reset counter to 0
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        // Increment counter; wrap around to 0 after reaching 15
        q <= q + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**:
    - The module is named `TopModule`.
    - Inputs are `clk` and `reset`, and the output `q` is a 4-bit register.

2. **Sequential Logic**:
    - An `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`.
    - Inside this block, we first check if `reset` is high.
    - If `reset` is high, we assign the value `0` to `q`.
    - If `reset` is low (i.e., the counter is not being reset), we increment `q` by 1. The inherent properties of a 4-bit register ensure that adding 1 to `15` wraps around to `0`.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Synthesis Friendly**: The code is written in a way that is compatible with most synthesis tools. It leverages a synchronous reset to initialize the counter and ensures that the counting operation is properly handled within a clock cycle.
- **Simulation and Testing**: To ensure the module behaves as intended, you would typically write a testbench that applies a clock signal, resets the counter, and checks the output `q` after several clock cycles.
