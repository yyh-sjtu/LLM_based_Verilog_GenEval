Certainly! Below is an example Verilog implementation for the `TopModule`, which behaves as specified. It generates a `shift_ena` signal that is high for exactly 4 clock cycles when reset is active high.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  reset,
    output reg shift_ena
);

    // State declaration
    reg [2:0] count;  // To count the number of cycles (3 bits for counting 0 to 7)

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Synchronous reset logic
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 0;    // Reset the counter
            shift_ena <= 1; // Enable shift for the first cycle
        end else begin
            // Check if we have counted to 4 cycles
            if (count < 4) begin
                shift_ena <= 1; // Keep shift_ena high
                count <= count + 1; // Increment the counter
            end else begin
                shift_ena <= 0; // Disable shift_ena after 4 cycles
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**: The module has three ports: `clk`, `reset`, and `shift_ena`.
2. **State Variable**: A 3-bit counter `count` is used to keep track of how many clock cycles `shift_ena` has been asserted.
3. **Always Block**: The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
   - If the `reset` is asserted (high), the counter is reset to `0` and `shift_ena` is set high.
   - If the `reset` is not active, the counter is checked:
     - If `count` is less than `4`, `shift_ena` remains high, and the counter increments.
     - When `count` reaches `4`, `shift_ena` is set to low, effectively disabling it until the next reset.

### Note:
- Make sure to test this module with a testbench to verify its functionality and confirm that it provides the expected output under various conditions.
- If you need further enhancements or additional features, feel free to ask!
