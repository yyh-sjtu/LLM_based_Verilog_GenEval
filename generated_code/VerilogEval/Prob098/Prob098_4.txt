Based on the given simulation waveforms, it appears that the module TopModule is a D flip-flop with the following truth table:

D  Q(t)  Q(t+1)
0   x      0
1   x      1
0   0      0
1   0      1
0   1      0
1   1      0

To implement this in RTL (Register Transfer Level), we can write the following Verilog code for TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if(a)
        q <= 1;
    else
        q <= 0;
end

endmodule
```

In this code, the always block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock. If the input a is high (1), the output q will be set to 1 on the next clock edge. Otherwise, the output q will be set to 0 on the next clock edge.

This implementation should match the behavior described by the simulation waveforms provided.
