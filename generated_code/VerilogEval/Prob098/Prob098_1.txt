Based on the provided simulation waveforms, it looks like the circuit implements a simple D flip-flop. Here is the RTL code for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input  clk,
  input  a,
  output reg q
);
  
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a) begin
      q <= 1'b1;
    end else begin
      q <= 1'b0;
    end
  end
  
endmodule
```

This code describes a module with one input clock signal, one input data signal (a), and one output signal (q). Inside the always block, the value of the output q is updated on the positive edge of the clock based on the input data a.
