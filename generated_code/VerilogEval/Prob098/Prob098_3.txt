Based on the provided simulation waveforms, the TopModule appears to be a D flip-flop with asynchronous reset functionality. When the clock signal (clk) transitions from 0 to 1, the output (q) will take on the value of the input (a). Additionally, if the input a is set to 1, the output q will remain at 1 regardless of the clock signal.

Here is the RTL code implementation of TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk or negedge a) begin
    if (!a) begin
        q <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        q <= a;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code snippet describes the behavior of a D flip-flop with an asynchronous reset signal (a). The output q is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal and is set to 0 when the reset signal a is low (0), and takes on the value of the input a when the reset signal is high (1).
