Based on the provided simulation waveforms, it appears that the circuit keeps the output q at 1 whenever the input a transitions from 0 to 1. The output q remains at 1 until a transitions back to 0. Therefore, the module TopModule can be implemented as a D flip-flop with the input connected to the D input and the clock connected to the clock input.

Here is the RTL code for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input a,
    output reg q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (a == 1'b1) begin
        q <= 1'b1;
    end else begin
        q <= 1'b0;
    end
end

endmodule
```

This implementation of TopModule matches the behavior observed in the simulation waveforms provided.
