Here is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that simulates the described game using the rules you've provided. The module will implement a 16x16 toroidal grid and will update the state of the grid on each clock edge based on the count of neighbors for each cell.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input       clk,
    input       load,
    input [255:0] data,
    output reg [255:0] q
);

// Internal registers to hold the next state and current state
reg [255:0] next_q;

// Function to count the alive neighbors for a given cell
function [3:0] count_neighbors;
    input [255:0] grid;
    input [3:0] x; // x coordinate
    input [3:0] y; // y coordinate
    integer i, j;
    begin
        count_neighbors = 0;
        // Check all 8 possible neighbors
        for (i = -1; i <= 1; i = i + 1) begin
            for (j = -1; j <= 1; j = j + 1) begin
                if (i == 0 && j == 0) continue; // Skip the cell itself
                // Calculate wrapped coordinates
                integer nx = (x + i + 16) % 16; // Wrap around for x
                integer ny = (y + j + 16) % 16; // Wrap around for y
                // Count if neighbor is alive (1)
                count_neighbors = count_neighbors + grid[nx*16 + ny];
            end
        end
    end
endfunction

// Sequential logic to update the grid
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (load) begin
        q <= data; // Load data on load signal
    end else begin
        // Calculate the next state
        integer x, y;
        for (x = 0; x < 16; x = x + 1) begin
            for (y = 0; y < 16; y = y + 1) begin
                integer alive_neighbors = count_neighbors(q, x, y);
                // Apply the game rules
                if (q[x*16 + y] == 1) begin
                    // Cell is currently alive
                    if (alive_neighbors == 2 || alive_neighbors == 3) begin
                        next_q[x*16 + y] = 1; // Remain alive
                    end else begin
                        next_q[x*16 + y] = 0; // Dies
                    end
                end else begin
                    // Cell is currently dead
                    if (alive_neighbors == 3) begin
                        next_q[x*16 + y] = 1; // Becomes alive
                    end else begin
                        next_q[x*16 + y] = 0; // Remains dead
                    end
                end
            end
        end
        q <= next_q; // Update the current state
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Module Definition**: The `TopModule` has defined input ports `clk`, `load`, and `data`, and an output port `q`, which reflects the current state of the grid.
  
2. **Neighbor Counting Function**: The `count_neighbors` function calculates the number of alive neighbors surrounding a cell located at `(x, y)`. It accounts for the toroidal wrapping of the grid.

3. **Sequential Logic**: 
    - When `load` is high, the module loads the initial state from the `data` input into the `q` output.
    - If `load` is not asserted, the module processes the current grid `q` to compute the next state (`next_q`) for each cell based on the defined rules of the game (alive or dead).

4. **State Update**: After calculating the next state during each clock cycle, it updates the state `q` with `next_q`.

This code is straightforward and assumes you will test it in a simulation environment or a hardware implementation to observe the behavior of the grid. Adjustments might be needed based on specific simulation environments, synthesis constraints, or additional requirements for your design.
