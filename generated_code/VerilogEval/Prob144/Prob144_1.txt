Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that describes the game you mentioned. This module is designed to handle a 16x16 toroidal grid, and it implements the rules specified for updating the cell states.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire load,
    input wire [255:0] data,
    output reg [255:0] q
);

    // Function to count the neighbors of a cell
    function [3:0] count_neighbors(input [255:0] state, input integer row, input integer col);
        integer rr, cc;
        integer count;
        begin
            count = 0;

            // Iterate over the 3x3 area around the cell (wrapping around for toroidal effect)
            for (rr = -1; rr <= 1; rr = rr + 1) begin
                for (cc = -1; cc <= 1; cc = cc + 1) begin
                    if (rr == 0 && cc == 0) 
                        continue; // Skip the cell itself

                    // Calculate wrapped indices
                    integer wrapped_row = (row + rr + 16) % 16;
                    integer wrapped_col = (col + cc + 16) % 16;

                    // Increment count if it is alive (1)
                    count = count + state[wrapped_row * 16 + wrapped_col][0];
                end
            end
            
            count_neighbors = count;
        end
    endfunction

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (load) begin
            // Load initial state
            q <= data;
        end else begin
            reg [255:0] new_q;
            integer r, c;
            
            // Compute new state
            for (r = 0; r < 16; r = r + 1) begin
                for (c = 0; c < 16; c = c + 1) begin
                    // Count neighbors
                    integer alive_neighbors = count_neighbors(q, r, c);
                    // Update state based on the rules
                    case (alive_neighbors)
                        0, 1: new_q[r * 16 + c] = 0; // Cell becomes dead
                        2: new_q[r * 16 + c] = q[r * 16 + c]; // Cell state remains the same
                        3: new_q[r * 16 + c] = 1; // Cell becomes alive
                        default: new_q[r * 16 + c] = 0; // 4+ neighbors => Cell becomes dead
                    endcase
                end
            end

            // Update q with the new state
            q <= new_q;
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **TopModule Interface**: The module has inputs for clock (`clk`), load signal (`load`), and a 256-bit vector for initial game state (`data`). It has a 256-bit output (`q`) to reflect the current state of the game.

2. **Neighbor Counting**: The `count_neighbors` function computes the number of alive neighbors surrounding a cell `(row, col)`. It uses a nested loop to check all 8 possible neighbors, handling wrapping using modulus arithmetic for a toroidal structure.

3. **State Transition Logic**:
   - On the positive edge of the clock, the module first checks if the `load` signal is active. If it is, `data` is loaded into `q` to initialize the state.
   - If `load` is not active, it computes the new state for each cell in the grid based on the counting results and specified rules:
     - 0-1 living neighbors results in death.
     - 2 living neighbors keeps the state unchanged.
     - 3 living neighbors results in birth (alive).
     - 4 or more living neighbors results in death.

4. **New State Update**: After computing the new state for all cells, `q` is updated with the newly calculated state.

### Note:
Make sure to instantiate this module and simulate it with appropriate test benches to verify the functionality, especially the edge conditions due to the toroidal wrap-around.
