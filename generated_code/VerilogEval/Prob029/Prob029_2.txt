Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule module implementing the described circuit:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input in1,
    input in2,
    input in3,
    output reg out
);

always @(*) begin
    // Two-input XNOR gate
    wire xnor_out;
    assign xnor_out = in1 ^ in2;

    // Two-input XOR gate
    assign out = xnor_out ^ in3;
end

endmodule
```

This code implements the circuit as described, with the input signals 'in1' and 'in2' connected to a two-input XNOR gate whose output is then connected to a two-input XOR gate along with 'in3'. The final output 'out' is the result of the XOR gate.
