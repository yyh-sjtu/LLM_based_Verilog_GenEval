Sure, here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing a 2-input AND gate:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    output out
);

assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with input ports a and b, and an output port out. The output out is assigned the result of the AND operation between inputs a and b. This module effectively implements a 2-input AND gate. Let me know if you need any further modifications or assistance.
