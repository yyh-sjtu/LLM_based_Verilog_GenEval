Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, which behaves as a 2-input AND gate.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,   // 1-bit input
    input wire b,   // 1-bit input
    output wire out // 1-bit output
);

// Implement the 2-input AND gate
assign out = a & b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The `module` keyword introduces the module with the name `TopModule`.
2. **Input and Output Declaration**:
   - `input wire a`: Declares `a` as a 1-bit input.
   - `input wire b`: Declares `b` as a 1-bit input.
   - `output wire out`: Declares `out` as a 1-bit output.
3. **AND Gate Implementation**: The `assign` statement continuously drives `out` with the result of the logical AND operation between `a` and `b`.

You can instantiate this module in a testbench or integrate it into a larger design as needed. If you have further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!
