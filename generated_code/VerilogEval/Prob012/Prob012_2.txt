Sure! Below is a simple Verilog implementation for the module named `TopModule` that functions as an XNOR gate based on the specified interface. 

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,    // Input a
    input wire b,    // Input b
    output wire out  // Output out
);

    // Implementing XNOR gate
    assign out = ~(a ^ b);  // XNOR gate is equivalent to NOT of XOR

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Module Declaration**: We declare a module named `TopModule` with `input` and `output` ports.
- **Port Types**: The inputs `a` and `b` are declared as `input wire`, and the output `out` is declared as `output wire`.
- **XNOR Logic**: The XNOR operation is implemented using the expression `~(a ^ b)`, where `^` denotes the XOR operation and `~` is the NOT operation. This effectively gives us the result of an XNOR gate.

This module can be instantiated in other modules or simulated to verify its functionality. If you have any specific simulation environment or additional requirements, let me know!
