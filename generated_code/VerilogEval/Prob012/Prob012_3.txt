Sure! Below is a simple implementation of a `TopModule` in Verilog that behaves as an XNOR gate. The module has two input ports (`a` and `b`) and one output port (`out`).

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,      // input signal a
    input b,      // input signal b
    output out    // output signal out
);

// Implementing the XNOR logic
assign out = ~(a ^ b); // XNOR logic: out is high when a and b are the same (both 0 or both 1)

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- `input a, b`: These are the input ports for the module.
- `output out`: This is the output port where the result will be driven.
- `assign out = ~(a ^ b);`: This line uses the XOR operation, which is then negated for the XNOR behavior. The output will be high (`1`) when both `a` and `b` are the same.

### Functional Behavior:
- If `a = 0` and `b = 0`, `out = 1`
- If `a = 0` and `b = 1`, `out = 0`
- If `a = 1` and `b = 0`, `out = 0`
- If `a = 1` and `b = 1`, `out = 1`
