Certainly! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` that acts as an XNOR gate. 

In Verilog, the `XNOR` operation can be expressed using the `~^` operator, which computes the bitwise XNOR. Hereâ€™s how you can implement your `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire out
);

// Implement the XNOR operation
assign out = ~(a ^ b);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The `input wire` statements define the inputs `a` and `b` to the module, both of which are single-bit signals.
- The `output wire` statement defines the output `out` of the module.
- The `assign` statement utilizes the expression `~(a ^ b)` to compute the XNOR of `a` and `b`. The `^` operator performs a bitwise XOR operation, and the `~` operator inverts the result, thus producing the XNOR.

You can synthesize this module in an RTL synthesis tool, and it will create the necessary hardware representation of an XNOR gate for the provided inputs.
