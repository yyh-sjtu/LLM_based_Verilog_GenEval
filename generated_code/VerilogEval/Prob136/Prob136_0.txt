Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule`, which incorporates a state machine based on the provided state transitions.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  reset,
    input  w,
    output reg z
);

    // State encoding
    typedef enum logic [2:0] {
        A = 3'b000,
        B = 3'b001,
        C = 3'b010,
        D = 3'b011,
        E = 3'b100,
        F = 3'b101
    } state_t;

    // State variable
    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Combinational logic for next state
    always_comb begin
        case (current_state)
            A: begin
                if (w == 0) next_state = B;
                else next_state = A;
            end
            
            B: begin
                if (w == 0) next_state = C;
                else next_state = D;
            end
            
            C: begin
                if (w == 0) next_state = E;
                else next_state = D;
            end
            
            D: begin
                if (w == 0) next_state = F;
                else next_state = A;
            end
            
            E: begin
                if (w == 0) next_state = E;
                else next_state = D;
            end
            
            F: begin
                if (w == 0) next_state = C;
                else next_state = D;
            end
            
            default: next_state = A; // Default to state A
        endcase
    end

    // Sequential logic for state transition
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= A;
            z <= 0; // Assuming z is 0 by default on reset
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Output logic
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        // Output z is 1 if in state E, else 0
        if (current_state == E) 
            z <= 1;
        else 
            z <= 0;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **State Encoding**: 
   - The states A, B, C, D, E, and F are defined using an enumerated type for clarity and ease of readability.

2. **Next State Logic**:
   - The `always_comb` block determines the next state based on the current state and input `w`. It follows the given transition table.

3. **State Transition**:
   - The `always_ff` block updates the current state on the positive edge of the clock or resets it to state A on a reset signal.

4. **Output Logic**:
   - The output `z` is set to 1 if the current state is E; otherwise, it is set to 0.

This module is designed to work under the assumption that all input and output signals are one bit wide, as per your specifications. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or additional functionality.
