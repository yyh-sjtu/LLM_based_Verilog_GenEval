Here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing a decade counter as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0000; // reset the counter to 0
    end else begin
        if (q == 4'b1001) begin
            q <= 4'b0000; // reset the counter to 0 when it reaches 9
        end else begin
            q <= q + 4'b0001; // increment the counter by 1
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code will implement a decade counter that counts from 0 through 9 with a period of 10. The counter will be reset to 0 when the reset input is high. The counter will increment by 1 on each clock cycle, and reset to 0 when it reaches 9.
