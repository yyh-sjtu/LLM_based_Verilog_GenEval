Sure, here is a RTL code implementation of the TopModule with the specified interface:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 4'b0000;
    end else begin
        if (q == 4'b1001) begin
            q <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            q <= q + 1;
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code implements a decade counter that counts from 0 to 9 with a period of 10, and resets to 0 when the reset input is asserted. The counter increments on every positive edge of the clock signal. Let me know if you need any further modifications or have any additional requirements.
