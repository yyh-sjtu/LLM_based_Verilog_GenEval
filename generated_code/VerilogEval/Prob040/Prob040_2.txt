Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` implementing a 4-bit decade counter that counts from 0 to 9. The counter resets to 0 on a high reset signal.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

    // Sequential logic to describe the behavior of the decade counter
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 4'b0000;  // Reset the counter to 0
        end else begin
            if (q == 4'b1001) begin
                q <= 4'b0000; // Reset to 0 after reaching 9
            end else begin
                q <= q + 1;   // Increment the counter
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Definition**: The module is named `TopModule` with inputs and outputs defined as specified.
2. **Output Register**: The `q` output is declared as a `reg`, indicating it is a register that will hold the counter value.
3. **Always Block**: The `always @(posedge clk)` block specifies that the following code will execute on the rising edge of the `clk`.
4. **Reset Logic**: Inside the always block, if `reset` is high, the counter `q` is set to 0.
5. **Counter Logic**: If `reset` is not high, the counter checks if it is equal to 9 (binary `1001`). If it is, `q` resets to 0; otherwise, it increments `q` by 1.

### Usage
This module can be instantiated in a larger design where you need a decade counter. Make sure to correctly apply the clock and reset signals for it to function as intended.
