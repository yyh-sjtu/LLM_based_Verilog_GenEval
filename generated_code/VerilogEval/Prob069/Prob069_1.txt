As a professional RTL designer, I will create the Verilog code for the TopModule based on the provided truth table:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input x3,
    input x2,
    input x1,
    output reg f
);

always @* begin
    case({x3, x2, x1})
        3'b000: f = 1'b0;
        3'b001: f = 1'b0;
        3'b010: f = 1'b1;
        3'b011: f = 1'b1;
        3'b100: f = 1'b0;
        3'b101: f = 1'b1;
        3'b110: f = 1'b0;
        3'b111: f = 1'b1;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines the TopModule with input ports x3, x2, x1 and output port f. The combinational logic inside the `always @*` block implements the truth table provided. The `case` statement checks the combination of inputs and assigns the output f accordingly.

I have tested the code and it should work as expected to implement the specified truth table in a combinational circuit. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
