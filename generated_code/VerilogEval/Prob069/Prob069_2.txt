Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the Verilog code for the TopModule implementing the combinational circuit based on the truth table you provided:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input x3,
    input x2,
    input x1,
    output f
);

assign f = (x3 & x2 & ~x1) | (x3 & ~x2 & x1) | (~x3 & x2 & x1) | (~x3 & ~x2 & ~x1);

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with the specified input and output ports. The assign statement calculates the output f based on the provided truth table conditions. Please let me know if you need any further modifications or assistance.
