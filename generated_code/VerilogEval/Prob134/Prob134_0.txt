Certainly! Below is the Verilog implementation for the `TopModule`, which uses the provided finite state machine (FSM) logic based on your state transition and output requirements. 

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire x,
    input  wire [2:0] y,
    output reg  Y0,
    output reg  z
);

    // Next state logic based on present state y and input x
    always @(*) begin
        case (y)
            3'b000: begin
                if (x)
                    Y0 = 1'b0;  // Next state is 001
                else
                    Y0 = 1'b0;  // Next state is still 000
                z = 1'b0;    // Output z is 0
            end

            3'b001: begin
                if (x)
                    Y0 = 1'b1;  // Next state is 100
                else
                    Y0 = 1'b1;  // Next state is still 001
                z = 1'b0;    // Output z is 0
            end

            3'b010: begin
                if (x)
                    Y0 = 1'b1;  // Next state is 001
                else
                    Y0 = 1'b0;  // Next state is still 010
                z = 1'b0;    // Output z is 0
            end

            3'b011: begin
                if (x)
                    Y0 = 1'b0;  // Next state is 010
                else
                    Y0 = 1'b1;  // Next state is still 001
                z = 1'b1;    // Output z is 1
            end

            3'b100: begin
                if (x)
                    Y0 = 1'b0;  // Next state is still 100
                else
                    Y0 = 1'b1;  // Next state is 011
                z = 1'b1;    // Output z is 1
            end

            default: begin
                Y0 = 1'b0;  // Default case
                z = 1'b0;   // Default case
            end
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
    - The module has one input (`x`), a 3-bit input (`y`), one output (`Y0`), and another output (`z`).

2. **FSM Logic**:
    - The `always @(*)` block is combinatorial logic responsible for determining the next state (`Y0`) and output (`z`) based on the current state (`y`) and input (`x`).

3. **State Transitions**:
    - The state transitions and outputs are defined according to the state table you provided. 

4. **Default Case**:
    - A default case is added to ensure that both `Y0` and `z` will have defined values even if an unexpected state is encountered.

Please ensure to simulate this module to verify its functionality against the state machine requirements!
