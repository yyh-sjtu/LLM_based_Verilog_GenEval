Hereâ€™s an implementation of the `TopModule` based on your specifications. This Verilog module represents a finite state machine (FSM) with a given state transition table and output logic. The states are represented as 3 bits, and the output `Y0` is derived from the next state as specified.

### Verilog Code for `TopModule`

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire x,
    input wire [2:0] y,
    output reg Y0,
    output reg z
);

    // Declare the next state variable
    reg [2:0] next_state;

    // Combinatorial logic for next state and output
    always @(*) begin
        // Default values
        next_state = y; // Hold the current state by default
        z = 0;          // Default output for z
        Y0 = next_state[0]; // Y0 is the least significant bit of the next state
        
        case (y)
            3'b000: begin
                if (x) begin
                    next_state = 3'b001; // y = 000, x = 1 -> next state = 001
                end else begin
                    next_state = 3'b000; // y = 000, x = 0 -> next state = 000
                end
                z = 0; // Output z remains 0
            end
            
            3'b001: begin
                if (x) begin
                    next_state = 3'b100; // y = 001, x = 1 -> next state = 100
                end else begin
                    next_state = 3'b001; // y = 001, x = 0 -> next state = 001
                end
                z = 0; // Output z remains 0
            end
            
            3'b010: begin
                if (x) begin
                    next_state = 3'b001; // y = 010, x = 1 -> next state = 001
                end else begin
                    next_state = 3'b010; // y = 010, x = 0 -> next state = 010
                end
                z = 0; // Output z remains 0
            end
            
            3'b011: begin
                if (x) begin
                    next_state = 3'b010; // y = 011, x = 1 -> next state = 010
                end else begin
                    next_state = 3'b001; // y = 011, x = 0 -> next state = 001
                end
                z = 1; // Output z set to 1
            end
            
            3'b100: begin
                if (x) begin
                    next_state = 3'b100; // y = 100, x = 1 -> next state = 100
                end else begin
                    next_state = 3'b011; // y = 100, x = 0 -> next state = 011
                end
                z = 1; // Output z set to 1
            end
            
            default: begin
                next_state = 3'b000; // default state
                z = 0; // output z set to default
            end
        endcase
    end

    // Sequential logic to hold the state
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        y <= next_state;
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` has inputs `x` (1 bit) and `y` (3 bits). It outputs `Y0` (1 bit) and `z` (1 bit).

2. **State Handling**: A `next_state` variable holds the next state computed from the present state `y` based on the value of `x`.

3. **Combinatorial Logic**: The `always @(*)` block calculates the next state and output `z` based on the current state `y` and input `x` using a case statement that corresponds to your state transition table.

4. **Sequential Logic**: An `always @(posedge clk)` block is suggested for the sequential part. Note that the clock (`clk`) should actually be included in the module since this is typically needed for state machines to update states.

5. **Output Assignment**: The output `Y0` is assigned the least significant bit of `next_state`.

### Notes

- Remember to include the clock signal in the module inputs and declare its behavior for a complete implementation.
- The default state handling should ensure the FSM is robust to unexpected states.
- This implementation assumes positive-edge-triggered behavior.

Feel free to modify and test the code based on your environment or simulator setup!
