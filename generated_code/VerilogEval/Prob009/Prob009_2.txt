Here is a possible implementation of the TopModule module in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [2:0] in,
    output [1:0] out
);

assign out = {in[2] & in[1], (in[2] ^ in[1]) & in[0]};

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the output variable 'out' is calculated based on the input vector 'in' using bitwise operations to count the number of '1's in the input vector. The first bit of 'out' represents the count of '1's in the higher two bits of 'in', and the second bit of 'out' represents the count of '1's in the lower bit of 'in'.

This circuit is known as a population count circuit, and this implementation should effectively count the number of '1's in the input vector as required.
