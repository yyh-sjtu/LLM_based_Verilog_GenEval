Certainly! To implement a module named `TopModule` that performs a population count on a 3-bit input and produces a 2-bit output representing the count of '1's in that input, we can use a simple combinatorial approach.

Here is an example of how you might write this in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [2:0] in,  // 3-bit input
    output [1:0] out  // 2-bit output
);

    // Internal signal to hold the population count
    wire [1:0] count;

    // Count the number of '1's in the input
    assign count[0] = in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2]; // XOR for LSB of population count
    assign count[1] = (in[0] & in[1]) | (in[0] & in[2]) | (in[1] & in[2]); // ANDs and ORs for MSB

    assign out = count;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input and Output Definition**:
   - `input [2:0] in`: This defines a 3-bit input.
   - `output [1:0] out`: This defines a 2-bit output.

2. **Population Count Logic**:
   - We use combinational logic to calculate the number of '1's in the input.
   - The LSB of the `count` (`count[0]`) is obtained by XORing all three bits, which gives us `1` if an odd number of inputs is `1`. 
   - The MSB of the `count` (`count[1]`) is computed using the combination of AND and OR gates to check for pairs of `1` inputs.

3. **Assign Statement**:
   - The final output is assigned the value of the count.

### Expected Outputs:
- If `in = 3'b000`, then `out = 2'b00` (0 ones).
- If `in = 3'b001`, then `out = 2'b01` (1 one).
- If `in = 3'b010`, then `out = 2'b01` (1 one).
- If `in = 3'b011`, then `out = 2'b10` (2 ones).
- If `in = 3'b100`, then `out = 2'b01` (1 one).
- If `in = 3'b101`, then `out = 2'b10` (2 ones).
- If `in = 3'b110`, then `out = 2'b10` (2 ones).
- If `in = 3'b111`, then `out = 2'b11` (3 ones).

### Note:
This is a basic combinational logic implementation. Depending on your requirements, you might also consider using behavioral constructs like `always` blocks or more advanced techniques for larger input sizes. However, for counting '1's in a 3-bit vector, this implementation is efficient and straightforward.
