Sure! Below is an example of how you can implement a "TopModule" that counts the number of '1's in a 3-bit input vector. The module will have a 3-bit input named `in` and a 2-bit output named `out`. The output will represent the population count of the input bits.

Here’s the RTL code in Verilog for the described module:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [2:0] in,  // 3-bit input
    output [1:0] out  // 2-bit output
);

    // Intermediate signal to hold population count
    wire [1:0] count;

    // Implementing the population count logic
    assign count = 
        (in[0] + in[1] + in[2]); // Count of 1's in the input
    
    assign out = count;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Input/Output Declaration**:
  - The input `in` is declared as a 3-bit vector (`[2:0]`).
  - The output `out` is a 2-bit vector (`[1:0]`), which can represent values from 0 to 3 for the population count of the 3-bit input.

- **Population Count Logic**:
  - The population count is calculated directly using the `+` operator on the input bits. 
  - Each bit in the input contributes to the count if it's `1`.

### Functionality:
This implementation will correctly provide the following outputs:
- When `in = 3'b000` → `out = 2'b00` (0 ones)
- When `in = 3'b001`, `3'b010`, or `3'b100` → `out = 2'b01` (1 one)
- When `in = 3'b011`, `3'b101`, or `3'b110` → `out = 2'b10` (2 ones)
- When `in = 3'b111` → `out = 2'b11` (3 ones)

This is a simple and effective way to implement a population count for a 3-bit input vector. If you have any specific requirements or variations you'd like to explore, please let me know!
