Sure! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, which computes an even parity bit for an 8-bit input. The parity bit will be the XOR of all 8 input bits.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire [7:0] in,    // 8-bit input
    output wire parity        // 1-bit parity output
);

    // Compute the parity bit using XOR reduction on the 8-bit input
    assign parity = ~(in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3] ^ in[4] ^ in[5] ^ in[6] ^ in[7]);

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The `TopModule` has one 8-bit input named `in` and one 1-bit output named `parity`.

2. **Parity Calculation**: The parity bit is calculated using the XOR operator (`^`). The result of all XOR operations on the bits of the input is negated using the NOT operator (`~`) to achieve the even parity.

### Usage:

This module can be instantiated in a larger design or simulated to check its functionality. You can feed different 8-bit input values and observe how the `parity` output changes accordingly.
