As a professional RTL designer, I would implement the TopModule in Verilog as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] in,
    output parity
);

reg parity;

always @(*) begin
    parity = in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3] ^ in[4] ^ in[5] ^ in[6] ^ in[7];
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the TopModule takes an 8-bit input 'in' and computes the parity bit using XOR operation on all 8 data bits. The result is stored in the output 'parity'. This module effectively adds a 9th parity bit to the input byte for error detection using even parity.
