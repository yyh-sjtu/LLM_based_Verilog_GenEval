Sure! Below is a simple implementation of a Verilog module named `TopModule` that computes the even parity bit for an 8-bit input byte.

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [7:0] in,    // 8-bit input
    output parity       // 1-bit parity output
);

    // Compute the parity bit using XOR
    assign parity = ~(in[0] ^ in[1] ^ in[2] ^ in[3] ^ in[4] ^ in[5] ^ in[6] ^ in[7]);
    
endmodule
```

### Explanation
1. **Input and Output Port Declaration**:
   - The module has one input port `in`, which is an 8-bit vector.
   - The output port `parity` is a single bit.

2. **Parity Calculation**:
   - The parity bit is calculated using the XOR operation on all 8 bits of the input. 
   - The output is negated to achieve even parity: if the number of 1s in the input is odd, the parity bit will be `1` to make it even; if the number of 1s is even, the parity bit will be `0`.

3. **Instantiation**:
   - This module can be instantiated in a larger design or tested using a testbench to ensure it operates correctly.

### Additional Considerations
- Make sure to simulate the module with various 8-bit inputs to validate the parity output.
- Adjust the parity calculation if you'd like to implement odd parity instead (simply remove the negation).

Feel free to ask if you need further adjustments or additional features!
