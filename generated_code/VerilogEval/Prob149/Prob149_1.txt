To implement the TopModule module as described, I will first design a state machine that will control the flow rate based on the water level and sensor changes. The state machine will have four states: ABOVE_S2, BETWEEN_S2_S1, BETWEEN_S1_S0, and BELOW_S0.

Here is the RTL code for TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [2:0] s,
    output fr2,
    output fr1,
    output fr0,
    output dfr
);

    // Define state encoding
    parameter ABOVE_S2 = 2'b00;
    parameter BETWEEN_S2_S1 = 2'b01;
    parameter BETWEEN_S1_S0 = 2'b10;
    parameter BELOW_S0 = 2'b11;

    // Define state register and next state logic
    reg [1:0] state, next_state;
    always @ (posedge clk or posedge reset)
    begin
        if (reset)
            state <= BELOW_S0;
        else
            state <= next_state;
    end
    
    // Output logic
    assign fr2 = (state == ABOVE_S2) ? 1'b0 : 1'b1;
    assign fr1 = (state == BETWEEN_S2_S1 || state == BETWEEN_S1_S0 || state == BELOW_S0) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
    assign fr0 = (state == BELOW_S0) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;
    assign dfr = (state == BETWEEN_S1_S0 || state == BELOW_S0) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;

    // State transition logic based on sensor inputs
    always @ (*)
    begin
        case(state)
            ABOVE_S2:
                if (s[2] == 1'b1)
                    next_state = BETWEEN_S2_S1;
                else
                    next_state = ABOVE_S2;
            BETWEEN_S2_S1:
                if (s[1] == 1'b1)
                    next_state = BETWEEN_S1_S0;
                else if (s[2] == 1'b0)
                    next_state = ABOVE_S2;
                else
                    next_state = BETWEEN_S2_S1;
            BETWEEN_S1_S0:
                if (s[0] == 1'b1)
                    next_state = BELOW_S0;
                else if (s[1] == 1'b0)
                    next_state = ABOVE_S2;
                else
                    next_state = BETWEEN_S1_S0;
            BELOW_S0:
                if (s[0] == 1'b0)
                    next_state = ABOVE_S2;
                else
                    next_state = BELOW_S0;
            default: next_state = ABOVE_S2;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

This RTL code implements the logic described in the problem statement, including the state machine that controls the flow rate based on the water level and sensor changes. The synchronous reset functionality is also included to reset the state machine to the initial state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time.
