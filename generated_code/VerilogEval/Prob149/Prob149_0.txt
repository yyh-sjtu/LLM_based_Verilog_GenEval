Certainly! Below is the Verilog RTL design for the `TopModule` as per your specifications. This design includes a simple state machine to implement the logic for the water level and flow rate control based on the sensor inputs.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire reset,
    input  wire [2:0] s,
    output reg  fr2,
    output reg  fr1,
    output reg  fr0,
    output reg  dfr
);
    
    // Define states for water level ranges
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        LOW_LEVEL = 2'b00,      // Below s[0]
        BETWEEN_S1_AND_S0 = 2'b01, // Between s[1] and s[0]
        BETWEEN_S2_AND_S1 = 2'b10, // Between s[2] and s[1]
        HIGH_LEVEL = 2'b11      // Above s[2]
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // Sequential logic: State update on clock or sync reset
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= LOW_LEVEL; // Reset state
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state;
        end
    end

    // Combinational logic: Determine next state and outputs
    always @* begin
        // Default output values
        fr2 = 1'b0;
        fr1 = 1'b0;
        fr0 = 1'b0;

        case (current_state)

                    fr1 = 1'b1;
                    fr0 = 1'b1;

### Overview of the Design

1. **State Representation**: The module uses a simple state machine with four states to represent the different levels implied by the sensor inputs:
    - `LOW_LEVEL`
    - `BETWEEN_S1_AND_S0`
    - `BETWEEN_S2_AND_S1`
    - `HIGH_LEVEL`

2. **Synchronous Reset**: An active-high synchronous reset returns the system to the `LOW_LEVEL` state where all flow rates are enabled.

3. **Output Logic**: The outputs (flow rates) are asserted based on the current state and sensor readings.

### Features
- The module combines both sequential and combinational logic to reflect the impact of sensor changes on flow rates effectively.
- The `dfr` output is controlled conditionally based on state transitions between levels.
