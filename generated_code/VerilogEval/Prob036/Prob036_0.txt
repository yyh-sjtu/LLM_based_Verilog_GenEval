Sure! Below is an example of a Verilog implementation for the `TopModule` as per your requirements:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire ring,
    input wire vibrate_mode,
    output wire ringer,
    output wire motor
);

    // Logic to determine the state of ringer and motor
    assign ringer = ring & ~vibrate_mode;  // Ringer is active only when ring signal is high and not in vibrate mode
    assign motor = ring & vibrate_mode;     // Motor is active only when ring signal is high and in vibrate mode

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

- **Inputs:**
  - `ring`: This input indicates whether there's an incoming call.
  - `vibrate_mode`: This input indicates whether the phone is set to vibrate mode.

- **Outputs:**
  - `ringer`: This output will be high (1) if the phone should ring.
  - `motor`: This output will be high (1) if the phone should vibrate.

### Logic:
- The output `ringer` is activated when there's an incoming call (`ring` is 1) and `vibrate_mode` is 0 (i.e., the phone is not in vibrate mode).
  
- The output `motor` is activated when there's an incoming call (`ring` is 1) and `vibrate_mode` is set to 1 (i.e., the phone is in vibrate mode).

In this way, the module ensures that both the ringer and the motor cannot be on simultaneously.
