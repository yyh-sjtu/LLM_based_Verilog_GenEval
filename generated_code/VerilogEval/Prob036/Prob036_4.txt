Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as per your specifications. This module will control the ringer and vibration motor based on the inputs `ring` and `vibrate_mode`.

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire ring,
    input wire vibrate_mode,
    output reg ringer,
    output reg motor
);
    
    always @(*) begin
        // Default outputs
        ringer = 0;
        motor = 0;

        // Check if there's an incoming call
        if (ring) begin
            // If vibrate mode is active, turn on the motor
            if (vibrate_mode) begin
                motor = 1;
            end
            // If not in vibrate mode, turn on the ringer
            else begin
                ringer = 1;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Ports**:
   - `ring`: Signal indicating an incoming call.
   - `vibrate_mode`: Signal indicating if the phone should be in vibrate mode.

2. **Output Ports**:
   - `ringer`: Signal to indicate if the ringer should be on (active high).
   - `motor`: Signal to indicate if the vibration motor should be on (active high).

3. **Behavior**:
   - The `always @(*)` block is used for combinational logic, which reacts to changes in the input signals.
   - Initially, both `ringer` and `motor` are set to `0`.
   - If `ring` is `1` (indicating an incoming call):
     - If `vibrate_mode` is `1`, then the motor is turned on (`motor = 1`).
     - If `vibrate_mode` is `0`, then the ringer is turned on (`ringer = 1`).

This setup ensures that either the ringer or the motor is activated based on the mode of operation while handling incoming calls efficiently.
