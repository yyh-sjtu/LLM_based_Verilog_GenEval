Sure! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule`. This module will control the ringer and vibration motor based on the given inputs.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire ring,
    input wire vibrate_mode,
    output reg ringer,
    output reg motor
);

// Always block that triggers on changes to inputs
always @(*) begin
    // Initialize outputs to 0
    ringer = 0;
    motor = 0;
    
    // Control logic for ringer and motor
    if (ring) begin
        if (vibrate_mode) begin
            motor = 1;  // Activate motor in vibrate mode
        end else begin
            ringer = 1; // Activate ringer when not in vibrate mode
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module `TopModule` takes two inputs (`ring` and `vibrate_mode`) and produces two outputs (`ringer` and `motor`).

2. **Always Block**: The `always @(*)` block is executed whenever there is a change in the input signals. This makes it combinatorial logic.

3. **Output Initialization**: The outputs `ringer` and `motor` are initialized to 0 to ensure they are turned off at the start.

4. **Control Logic**:
   - First, it checks if an incoming call is indicated by the `ring` signal.
   - If `ring` is high and `vibrate_mode` is low, the `ringer` output is set to 1.
   - If `ring` is high and `vibrate_mode` is high, the `motor` output is set to 1.
   - Note that the outputs are mutually exclusive due to the use of the `else` clause.

This design ensures that only one of the outputs can be activated at a time, fulfilling the operational requirement you specified.
