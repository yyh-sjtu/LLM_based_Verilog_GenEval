Certainly! Based on the provided Karnaugh map, let's first translate the minterms into a truth table and then derive the implementation for the RTL design of the `TopModule`.

The Karnaugh map indicates the following outputs for the given combinations of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`:

```
              ab
   cd   00  01  11  10
   00 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |  -> minterms: 0, 1, 3
   01 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |  -> minterms: 4, 7
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |  -> minterms: 5, 6, 7
   10 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  -> minterms: 8, 9
```

From the above Karnaugh map, the corresponding minterms (in decimal) where the output is `1` are:
- \(m_0\) (a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0)
- \(m_1\) (a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 1)
- \(m_4\) (a = 0, b = 1, c = 0, d = 0)
- \(m_3\) (a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0)
- \(m_5\) (a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d = 1)
- \(m_6\) (a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0)
- \(m_7\) (a = 1, b = 1, c = 0, d = 1)
- \(m_8\) (a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0)
- \(m_9\) (a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, d = 0)

From this list, we can simplify the equation using grouping methods from the K-map. After extracting simplifications, we can find:

```
out = (not a and not b and d) or 
      (not a and c) or
      (a and b and not c and not d) or 
      (a and not b and c and d)
```

This is a simplified Boolean expression for the output `out`.

Now, let's implement the module `TopModule` in Verilog:

### Verilog Implementation

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    output wire out
);

    assign out = (~a & ~b & d) |    // m0, m1
                 (~a & c) |        // m4
                 (a & b & ~c & ~d) | // m8
                 (a & ~b & c & d); // m7

endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - The module named `TopModule` has four input ports (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) and one output port (`out`).

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The output `out` is determined using the simplified logic expression derived from the Karnaugh map.
   - The `assign` statement implements the logic using bit-level operations.

This Verilog module can now be synthesized into hardware to create the specified circuit based on the Karnaugh map provided.
