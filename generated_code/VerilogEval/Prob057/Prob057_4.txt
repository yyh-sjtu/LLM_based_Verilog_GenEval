As a professional RTL designer, I will create the TopModule according to the provided Karnaugh map. The module will have input ports a, b, c, and d, and output port out.

Here is the Verilog RTL code for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output reg out
);

always @ (*) begin
    case({c, d})
        2'b00: out = 1'b1;
        2'b01: out = a & b;
        2'b11: out = c | d;
        2'b10: out = a ^ b;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

This module will correctly implement the circuit described by the Karnaugh map provided. Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications.
