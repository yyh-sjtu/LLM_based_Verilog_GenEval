As a professional RTL designer, I will begin by defining the module TopModule in Verilog with the specified inputs and outputs. I will then implement the gshare branch predictor logic as described in the requirements, including the pattern history table (PHT), two-bit saturating counters, and global branch history register. I will ensure that the branch predictor functions correctly for both prediction and training operations, following the timing constraints provided. Additionally, I will design the module to operate on the positive edge of the clock signal and properly handle asynchronous active-high reset. Finally, I will simulate and verify the functionality of the TopModule to ensure it meets the desired specifications. Let me know if you have any specific requirements or questions regarding the implementation.
