To implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop in an FPGA without using dual-edge sensitive logic, we can create a circuit that effectively emulates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop using two separate flip-flops in series.

Here is a possible implementation of the TopModule module in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

reg q_int;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q_int <= d; // First flip-flop triggered on positive edge
end

always @(negedge clk) begin
    q <= q_int; // Second flip-flop triggered on negative edge, output updated
end

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the input signal d is latched into the first flip-flop on the positive edge of the clock signal. Then, the output signal q_int from the first flip-flop is latched into the second flip-flop on the negative edge of the clock signal, effectively emulating the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop.

This circuit design ensures that changes to the input signal d are captured on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal, allowing for dual-edge triggering behavior without the need for specialized dual-edge triggered flip-flops.
