To implement a dual-edge triggered flip-flop in Verilog without using a legal sensitivity list that includes both edges of the clock, you can use an additional clock signal derived from the original `clk` in combination with a latch mechanism.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation using registers and two processes to handle the behavior as required:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,        // Clock input
    input d,          // Data input
    output reg q      // Data output
);

    reg d_latch;      // Intermediate latch to hold the value of 'd'

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        d_latch <= d; // Latch the data on the rising edge of clk
        q <= d_latch; // Output 'q' receives the value of 'd_latch'
    end
    
    always @(negedge clk) begin
        q <= d;       // Output 'q' receives the value of 'd' on falling edge
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Definition**: `TopModule` has an input clock `clk`, data input `d`, and an output `q`.
  
2. **Intermediate Register**: A register `d_latch` is introduced to hold the value of `d` temporarily.

3. **Rising Edge Latch**:
   - On the rising edge of `clk`, the current value of input `d` is latched into `d_latch`.
   - The output `q` is then updated with the value from `d_latch`.

4. **Falling Edge Update**:
   - On the falling edge of `clk`, the output `q` is updated directly with the current value of `d`.

### Behavior:
- The output `q` reflects the value of `d` on both rising and falling edges of the clock signal.
- This effectively mimics the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop, while adhering to FPGA design constraints.

### Note:
This implementation assumes a relatively slow logic so that the data input `d` is stable through the clock edges; timing analysis must be performed to ensure correct operation in a real design.
