To implement a module named TopModule with the specified interface including a dual-edge triggered flip-flop functionality, I would utilize a pair of D flip-flops cascaded together with complementary clock signals to achieve the desired behavior. Here is a Verilog code snippet for the TopModule implementation:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

reg q1, q2;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    q1 <= d;
end

always @(negedge clk) begin
    q2 <= q1;
end

assign q = q2;

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the input signal 'd' is first captured by the flip-flop q1 on the rising edge of the clock. Then, on the falling edge of the clock, the signal from q1 is captured by the second flip-flop q2. This cascaded structure effectively emulates the behavior of a dual-edge triggered flip-flop by capturing the input signal on both edges of the clock. Finally, the output 'q' is driven by the signal stored in the second flip-flop q2.

This implementation ensures that the module behaves functionally like a dual-edge triggered flip-flop while conforming to the limitations of FPGA architectures.
