Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule`. This module has 16 D flip-flops that are controlled by the `byteena` inputs for selecting which bytes of the `d` input to write to. The output `q` will reflect the current values stored in the flip-flops.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input resetn,
    input [1:0] byteena,
    input [15:0] d,
    output reg [15:0] q
);

// 16 D flip-flops
reg [15:0] dff;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (!resetn) begin
        // Synchronous active-low reset
        dff <= 16'b0;
    end else begin
        // Update flip-flops based on byteena
        if (byteena[0]) begin // Write to lower byte (D[7:0])
            dff[7:0] <= d[7:0];
        end
        if (byteena[1]) begin // Write to upper byte (D[15:8])
            dff[15:8] <= d[15:8];
        end
    end
end

// Assign internal register to output
always @(*) begin
    q = dff;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronization.
   - `resetn`: Active-low synchronous reset signal.
   - `byteena`: A 2-bit signal used to determine which bytes of the input data should be written to the flip-flops.
   - `d`: 16-bit input data that will be stored in the flip-flops.
   - `q`: A 16-bit output that holds the current values of the flip-flops.

2. **Registers**:
   - `dff`: A 16-bit register that holds the state of the D flip-flops.

3. **Sequential Logic**:
   - The `always @(posedge clk)` block describes the behavior on the rising edge of the clock.
   - It checks if `resetn` is low, and if so, it resets all the bits of `dff` to 0.
   - Depending on the `byteena` signals, it updates the appropriate byte of `dff` with the corresponding bytes from `d`.

4. **Combinatorial Logic**:
   - The second `always @(*)` block continuously assigns the value of `dff` to the output `q`. This ensures `q` always reflects the current state of the flip-flops.

This design captures the functionality as described, implementing a simple byte-enabled write mechanism to a register bank using D flip-flops.
