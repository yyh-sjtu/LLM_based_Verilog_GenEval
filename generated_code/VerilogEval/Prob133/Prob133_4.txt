To implement the `TopModule` finite state machine (FSM) as described, we first need to define the states and the transitions based on the inputs `s` and `w`. 

Given the requirements:
- The FSM starts in state **A** and remains there as long as `s == 0`.
- When `s == 1`, the FSM transitions to state **B** where it will sample the input `w` for three clock cycles.
- After sampling, if `w` equals `1` in exactly two out of the three clock cycles, the output `z` should be set to `1` in the next clock cycle, otherwise `z` is set to `0`.

### States Definition:
1. **State A**: Waiting for signal `s` to go high.
2. **State B**: Sampling the `w` input for three clock cycles:
    - `count[2:0]`: A 3-bit counter to keep track of the number of cycles and state transitions.

### FSM Logic:
- In **State A**: 
  - If `s == 0`, stay in State A.
  - If `s == 1`, move to State B and initialize the counter.
  
- In **State B**: 
  - Sample the input `w` for three clock cycles:
    - After three samples, check the count of `w` = 1 to determine the output `z`.

The total number of states can be reduced to two: A and B.

### Verilog Implementation
Here's a Verilog implementation of the described FSM.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,
    input  wire reset,
    input  wire s,
    input  wire w,
    output reg  z
);

    // State Encoding
    typedef enum logic {STATE_A, STATE_B} state_t;
    state_t state, next_state;

    // Counter for the number of '1's received
    reg [2:0] count; // 3-bit counter (0 to 3)

    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= STATE_A; // Reset to state A
            count <= 3'b000;   // Reset the counter
            z <= 0;            // Reset output z
        end else begin
            state <= next_state; // Move to the next state
        end
    end

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (state == STATE_B) begin
            if (count < 3) begin
                count <= count + 1; // Increment the counter until it reaches 3
            end else begin
                // After three cycles, evaluate the count
                if (count == 3'b010) begin
                    z <= 1; // Two ones were detected
                end else begin
                    z <= 0; // Not two ones
                end
                count <= 3'b000; // Reset the counter for the next sequence
            end
        end else begin
            z <= 0; // In state A, output z is always 0
        end
    end

    // FSM state transition
    always_comb begin
        case (state)
            STATE_A: begin
                if (s) begin
                    next_state = STATE_B; // Transition to B on s = 1
                    count = 0; // Initialize count when entering state B
                end else begin
                    next_state = STATE_A; // Remain in state A
                end
            end
            STATE_B: begin
                if (count < 3) begin
                    next_state = STATE_B; // Stay in B until we've sampled three times
                end else begin
                    next_state = STATE_B; // Remain in B for the next evaluation
                end
            end
            default: next_state = STATE_A; // Default state if unknown
        endcase
    end

    // Count logic
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (state == STATE_B) begin
            if(count < 3) begin
                if (w) begin
                    count <= count + 1; // Increment count if w is 1
                end
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The FSM has two states: `STATE_A` and `STATE_B`.
- In `STATE_A`, the FSM waits for `s` to go high.
- Once `s` is high, it transitions to `STATE_B`, where it counts the number of times `w` equals 1 over three clock cycles.
- After sampling, it checks the count of ones and sets `z` accordingly.
- The counter resets after checking the condition and continues to sample in `STATE_B` until `s` goes low again.

This implementation fulfills the specified behavior of the finite state machine with the correct handling of inputs and outputs.
