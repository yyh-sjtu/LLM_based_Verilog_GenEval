Based on the provided simulation waveforms, it appears that the output q is determined by the values of input a, b, c, d, and e. The output q seems to be the value of e when c is equal to b, and if c is not equal to b, then q is equal to f.

Based on this logic, the Verilog RTL code for the TopModule could be as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [3:0] a,
    input [3:0] b,
    input [3:0] c,
    input [3:0] d,
    input [3:0] e,
    output reg [3:0] q
);

always @* begin
    case(c)
        b: q = e;
        default: q = 4'b1111; // f in binary representation
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

Please note that in this implementation, the input and output ports are defined with a width of 4 bits each to match the simulation waveforms provided. The combinational logic inside the `always @*` block checks if c is equal to b, in which case q is set to e. If c is not equal to b, q is set to the binary value of f (1111). This Verilog code should implement the desired combinational circuit based on the provided specifications and waveforms.
