To implement the top-level module with the described interface, we will need to instantiate the A and B modules and connect them as specified. Here is the Verilog code snippet for the top-level module:

```verilog
module top_module(
    input x,
    input y,
    output z
);

wire a1_out, a2_out, b1_out, b2_out, or_out, and_out;

module_A A1(.x(x), .y(y), .z(a1_out));
module_A A2(.x(x), .y(y), .z(a2_out));
module_B B1(.x(x), .y(y), .z(b1_out));
module_B B2(.x(x), .y(y), .z(b2_out));

assign or_out = a1_out | b1_out;
assign and_out = a2_out & b2_out;
assign z = or_out ^ and_out;

endmodule
```

In this code snippet:
- A1 and A2 are instances of Module A, with inputs x and y connected to the top-level inputs, and outputs a1_out and a2_out respectively.
- B1 and B2 are instances of Module B, with inputs x and y connected to the top-level inputs, and outputs b1_out and b2_out respectively.
- The outputs of A1 and B1 are connected to an OR gate to calculate or_out.
- The outputs of A2 and B2 are connected to an AND gate to calculate and_out.
- Finally, the outputs of the OR and AND gates are connected to an XOR gate to calculate the final output z.

This implementation will replicate the behavior of the given simulation waveform using the specified A and B submodules.
