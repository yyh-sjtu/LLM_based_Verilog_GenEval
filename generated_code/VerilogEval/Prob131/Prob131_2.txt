As an RTL designer, I would start by designing the top-level module based on the given description. I would instantiate two A submodules and two B submodules, ensuring that their inputs are connected correctly to the input signals 'x' and 'y'. 

For the first pair of A and B submodules, I would connect the output of the A submodule to one input of an OR gate, and the output of the B submodule to the other input of the OR gate. For the second pair of A and B submodules, I would connect the outputs to an AND gate in a similar manner. 

Finally, I would connect the output of the OR gate and the output of the AND gate to an XOR gate, with the output of the XOR gate being the output signal 'z' of the top-level module.

After designing the module, I would perform RTL simulation and verification to ensure that the functionality matches the given waveform and that the design is correct. I would also perform synthesis and optimization to generate the corresponding hardware implementation.
