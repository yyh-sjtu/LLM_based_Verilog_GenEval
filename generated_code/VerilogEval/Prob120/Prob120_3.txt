Certainly! Below is an implementation of the `TopModule` in Verilog, which represents a Moore state machine based on the provided state transition table.

Here's the RTL code:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input in,
    output reg out
);

    // State Encoding
    typedef enum reg [1:0] {
        A = 2'b00,
        B = 2'b01,
        C = 2'b10,
        D = 2'b11
    } state_t;

    state_t current_state, next_state;

    // State Transition Logic
    always @(*) begin
        // Default next state and output
        next_state = current_state;
        out = 1'b0; // Default output value

        case (current_state)
            A: begin
                if (in) next_state = B;
                // Output is already set to 0
            end
            B: begin
                if (in) next_state = B; // stays in B
                else next_state = C;
                // Output is already set to 0
            end
            C: begin
                if (in) next_state = D;
                else next_state = A;
                // Output is already set to 0
            end
            D: begin
                if (in) next_state = B;
                else next_state = C;
                out = 1'b1; // Output is 1 in state D
            end
            default: next_state = A; // Fallback to state A for safety
        endcase
    end

    // Output Logic and State Update Logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            current_state <= A; // Reset to State A
            out <= 1'b0;        // Output should also be reset
        end else begin
            current_state <= next_state; // Update current state
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **State Encoding:** The states A, B, C, and D are represented using a 2-bit enumerated type for clarity.

2. **State Transition Logic:** The state transitions are defined in a combinational block triggered by the `current_state`. Depending on the value of the input `in`, the next state is determined, and the output is assigned based on the current state.

3. **Synchronous Reset:** In the sequential logic block, on a positive edge of the clock or a positive edge of the reset, the current state is either reset to state A or updated based on the `next_state`.

4. **Output Handling:** The output `out` is directly assigned when in state D, and itâ€™s defaulted to 0 for all other states.

This code can be simulated to validate the state machine behavior according to the provided transition table.
