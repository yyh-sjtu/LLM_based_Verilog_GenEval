Sure! Below is an RTL implementation of the `TopModule` that adheres to the given state transition table for a Moore state machine. This example is written in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire in,
    output reg out
);

// State Encoding
typedef enum reg [1:0] {
    A = 2'b00,
    B = 2'b01,
    C = 2'b10,
    D = 2'b11
} state_t;

state_t current_state, next_state;

// State Transition Logic
always @(*) begin
    case (current_state)
        A: begin
            if (in) begin
                next_state = B;
            end else begin
                next_state = A;
            end
            out = 1'b0;
        end
        
        B: begin
            if (in) begin
                next_state = B;
            end else begin
                next_state = C;
            end
            out = 1'b0;
        end
        
        C: begin
            if (in) begin
                next_state = D;
            end else begin
                next_state = A;
            end
            out = 1'b0;
        end
        
        D: begin
            if (in) begin
                next_state = B;
            end else begin
                next_state = C;
            end
            out = 1'b1;
        end
        
        default: begin
            next_state = A;
            out = 1'b0; // Default output
        end
    endcase
end

// State Update Logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        current_state <= A; // Reset to state A
        out <= 1'b0; // Output on reset
    end else begin
        current_state <= next_state; // Update state
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **State Encoding**:
   - States A, B, C, D are encoded as 2-bit values using an enumerated type (`typedef enum`). This improves readability.

2. **State Transition Logic**:
   - The `always @(*)` block is used to derive the next state and the output based on the current state and the input `in`.
   - Outputs are assigned directly within the case statements since it is a Moore machine (outputs are only a function of the state).

3. **State Update Logic**:
   - The state is updated synchronously on the positive edge of the `clk`. An asynchronous reset (`reset`) sets the current state to `A`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The output `out` changes based only on the current state.

### Synthesis Considerations:
This implementation is straightforward and can be synthesized easily for hardware. Make sure to test the design in a simulation environment to ensure it behaves as expected.
