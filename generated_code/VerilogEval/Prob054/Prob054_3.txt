Here is the RTL code for the TopModule module as per your requirements:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

reg [7:0] prev_in;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    prev_in <= in;
    pedge <= 8'b0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
        if (prev_in[i] == 1 && in[i] == 0) begin
            pedge[i] <= 1;
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

In this code snippet, the TopModule module takes in the clock signal `clk`, an 8-bit input signal `in`, and has an 8-bit output signal `pedge` to indicate the positive edge detection for each bit in the input signal.

Inside the `always @(posedge clk)` block, the previous value of the input signal `prev_in` is stored. The code then iterates through each bit of the input signal and checks for a transition from 0 to 1. If such a transition is detected for a bit, the corresponding bit in the `pedge` output signal is set to 1 in the next clock cycle.

This module will effectively detect positive edges in the 8-bit input signal and provide the output in the `pedge` signal.
