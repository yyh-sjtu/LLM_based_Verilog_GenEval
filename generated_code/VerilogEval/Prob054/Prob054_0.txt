As a professional RTL designer, I would create a Verilog module named TopModule with the specified interface. The module would utilize a flip-flop to store the state of each bit in the 8-bit input vector. On each rising edge of the clk signal, I would compare the current input value with the stored value from the previous clock cycle. If a 0 to 1 transition is detected for any bit, the corresponding bit in the pedge output would be set high in the next clock cycle.

I would write the Verilog code for TopModule as follows:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

reg [7:0] prev_in;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    prev_in <= in;

    for (int i=0; i<8; i=i+1) begin
        if (prev_in[i] == 1 && in[i] == 0) begin
            pedge[i] <= 1;
        end else begin
            pedge[i] <= 0;
        end
    end
end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code defines a module named TopModule with input ports clk and in, and output port pedge. Inside the always block sensitive to the posedge of the clk signal, the module compares the current input values with the previous values stored in prev_in. If a 0 to 1 transition is detected for any bit in the input vector, the corresponding bit in the pedge output is set high in the next clock cycle.

With this implementation, the module TopModule accurately detects positive edge transitions in the 8-bit input vector and provides the corresponding output in the pedge signal.
