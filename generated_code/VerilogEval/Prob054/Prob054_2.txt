Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of the `TopModule` that detects positive edges on an 8-bit input vector `in` and generates an 8-bit output vector `pedge`. The output will be set to 1 for bit positions that experience a transition from 0 to 1 on the rising edge of the clock.

Here's the Verilog code for the TopModule:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

    // Create a register to hold the previous state of 'in'
    reg [7:0] prev_in;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Check for positive edge detection
        pedge <= in & ~prev_in;  // Set 'pedge' to 1 where 'in' is 1 and 'prev_in' is 0
        prev_in <= in;           // Update the previous state to the current state
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Definition**: The module `TopModule` defines the inputs and outputs.

2. **Registers**:
   - `prev_in`: This register holds the value of `in` from the previous clock cycle.

3. **Edge Detection Logic**:
   - On every positive edge of the `clk`, the module checks for positive edge transitions.
   - The expression `in & ~prev_in` computes the bitwise AND of `in` and the complement of `prev_in`. This results in a value where bits are set to 1 only when a 0-to-1 transition is detected.

4. **Output Assignment**:
   - `pedge <= in & ~prev_in;` updates the `pedge` output register to capture the positive edges.
   - `prev_in <= in;` updates the previous input state for the next cycle.

### Usage:
This module can be instantiated in a larger design where you can provide a clock, input an 8-bit vector (`in`), and observe the output vector (`pedge`) for any positive edge transitions on the input.

Feel free to modify or expand upon this implementation as needed for your specific requirements!
