Certainly! Below is an RTL implementation of your `TopModule` in Verilog. This module detects positive edges of each bit in an 8-bit input vector and produces an output vector that indicates which bits changed from `0` to `1`.

### Verilog Code for TopModule
```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] pedge
);

    // Reg to hold the previous state of the input
    reg [7:0] in_prev;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        // Detect positive edges
        pedge <= (in & ~in_prev);  // Set pedge to 1 where in is 1 and in_prev is 0
        in_prev <= in;              // Update previous input state
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation
1. **Inputs and Outputs**: We have a clock (`clk`), an 8-bit input (`in`), and an 8-bit output (`pedge`).
  
2. **Previous State Storage**: We use a register `in_prev` to store the state of `in` from the previous clock cycle.

3. **Always Block**: Upon the rising edge of the clock, we:
   - Set `pedge` to detect where positive edges occur in the input:
     - The expression `(in & ~in_prev)` checks each bit, setting it in `pedge` to `1` if the current input bit is `1`, but the previous input bit was `0`.
   - Update `in_prev` to the current value of `in` to prepare for the next clock cycle.

### Usage
This module can be instantiated in a larger design. It will correctly output `pedge` as an 8-bit vector, indicating the positive transitions of the corresponding bits in the `in` vector.

### Simulation and Testing
Make sure to test this module in simulation using a suitable testbench. The testbench can provide a clock signal and various test vectors for the input to verify the correctness of edge detection.
