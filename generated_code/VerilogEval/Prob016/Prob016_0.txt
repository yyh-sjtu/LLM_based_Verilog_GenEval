Certainly! Below, I'll provide you with a Verilog implementation for the `TopModule`, which implements a 4-bit adder using full adders. The addition logic will take two 4-bit inputs (`x` and `y`) and produce a 5-bit output (`sum`) to account for possible overflow.

### Verilog Code for TopModule

```verilog
module FullAdder (
    input  a,    // First input bit
    input  b,    // Second input bit
    input  cin,  // Carry input
    output sum,  // Sum output
    output cout  // Carry output
);
    assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;      // Sum is the XOR of inputs
    assign cout = (a & b) | (cin & (a ^ b)); // Carry is generated
endmodule

module TopModule (
    input  [3:0] x,    // 4-bit input x
    input  [3:0] y,    // 4-bit input y
    output [4:0] sum   // 5-bit output including overflow
);
    wire [3:0] carry; // Intermediate carry signals

    // Instantiate Full Adders for each bit
    FullAdder FA0 (.a(x[0]), .b(y[0]), .cin(1'b0),       .sum(sum[0]), .cout(carry[0]));
    FullAdder FA1 (.a(x[1]), .b(y[1]), .cin(carry[0]),  .sum(sum[1]), .cout(carry[1]));
    FullAdder FA2 (.a(x[2]), .b(y[2]), .cin(carry[1]),  .sum(sum[2]), .cout(carry[2]));
    FullAdder FA3 (.a(x[3]), .b(y[3]), .cin(carry[2]),  .sum(sum[3]), .cout(carry[3]));

    // The final carry out is the MSB of the sum output (overflow bit)
    assign sum[4] = carry[3];

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **FullAdder Module**:
    - This module takes two inputs `a` and `b` and a carry-in `cin`.
    - It computes the sum as the XOR of `a`, `b`, and `cin`.
    - The carry-out `cout` is generated using the logic: \( cout = (a \land b) \lor (cin \land (a \oplus b)) \).

2. **TopModule**:
    - The `TopModule` contains two 4-bit inputs, `x` and `y`, and one 5-bit output `sum`.
    - It instantiates four `FullAdder` modules (FA0 to FA3) for each bit of the 4-bit inputs.
    - The first full adder takes the least significant bits of `x` and `y` along with a carry-in of 0.
    - Each subsequent full adder takes the next bits along with the carry-out from the previous adder as its carry-in.
    - Finally, the overflow bit is taken from the carry-out of the most significant full adder (FA3) and assigned to `sum[4]`.

### Simulation and Testing
To test this circuit, you can instantiate the `TopModule` in a testbench and apply different combinations of `x` and `y` to verify that the `sum` output behaves as expected, appropriately reflecting the overflow when inputs exceed the 4-bit limit.
