Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` you described. This module will process a 16-bit `scancode` input and assert one of the four output signals (`left`, `down`, `right`, `up`) based on the received scancode corresponding to the PS/2 keyboard arrow keys.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire [15:0] scancode,
    output reg left,
    output reg down,
    output reg right,
    output reg up
);

// Procedure to interpret scancode
always @(*) begin
    // Default Outputs
    left = 0;
    down = 0;
    right = 0;
    up = 0;

    // Check for each scancode
    case (scancode)
        16'hE06B: left = 1;   // Left arrow
        16'hE072: down = 1;   // Down arrow
        16'hE074: right = 1;  // Right arrow
        16'hE075: up = 1;     // Up arrow
        default: ;             // No output for anything else
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule`, and it has one input, `scancode`, which is 16 bits wide, and four outputs: `left`, `down`, `right`, and `up`, all of which are 1 bit wide.

2. **Output Logic**: The outputs are declared as `reg` types because they will be assigned within an `always` block, which is triggered whenever any of its inputs change.

3. **Default Values**: At the beginning of the `always` block, all output signals are initialized to `0`.

4. **Case Statement**: A `case` statement is used to check the value of the `scancode`. Depending on the value, the appropriate output signal is set to `1`.
   - `16'hE06B`: Sets `left` to `1`.
   - `16'hE072`: Sets `down` to `1`.
   - `16'hE074`: Sets `right` to `1`.
   - `16'hE075`: Sets `up` to `1`.
   - If the scancode doesnâ€™t match any specific value, the default case does nothing, leaving all outputs low.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the environment you are using supports synthesizing Verilog code.
- The module assumes that the `scancode` is provided as needed without any additional synchronization or timing constraints.
