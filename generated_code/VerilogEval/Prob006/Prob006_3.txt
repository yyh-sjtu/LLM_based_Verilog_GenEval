To implement the TopModule with the specified interface, I would write the following RTL code in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [7:0] in,
    output reg [7:0] out
);

always @* begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
        out[i] = in[7 - i];
    end
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with an 8-bit input port `in` and an 8-bit output port `out`. Inside the `always` block, a loop is used to reverse the bit ordering of the input port and assign the result to the output port.
