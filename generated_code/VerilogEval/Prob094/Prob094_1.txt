Here is the RTL code implementation of the TopModule as described:

```verilog
module TopModule (
  input [3:0] in,
  output [3:0] out_both,
  output [3:0] out_any,
  output [3:0] out_different
);

  // Logic for out_both
  assign out_both = {in[3] & in[0], in[0] & in[1], in[1] & in[2], in[2] & in[3]};
  
  // Logic for out_any
  assign out_any = {in[3] | in[0], in[0] | in[1], in[1] | in[2], in[2] | in[3]};
  
  // Logic for out_different
  assign out_different = {in[3] != in[0], in[0] != in[1], in[1] != in[2], in[2] != in[3]};

endmodule
```

This code snippet defines a module named TopModule with the specified input and output ports. The logic for each output is implemented using bitwise operations to compare the input bits and their neighboring bits as described. The out_both output checks if both the input bit and its neighbor to the left are '1', out_any checks if either of the input bit or its neighbor to the right is '1', and out_different checks if the input bit is different from its neighbor to the left (treating the vector as wrapping around).
