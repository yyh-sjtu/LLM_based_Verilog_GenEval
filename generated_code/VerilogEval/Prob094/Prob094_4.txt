Sure! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that meets your specified requirements for the input and output ports.

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input wire [3:0] in,
    output wire [3:0] out_both,
    output wire [3:0] out_any,
    output wire [3:0] out_different
);

// Assigning out_both based on the condition for each bit and its left neighbor
assign out_both[0] = 1'b0;                 // There's no neighbor to the left for in[0]
assign out_both[1] = in[1] & in[0];       // Both in[1] and in[0]
assign out_both[2] = in[2] & in[1];       // Both in[2] and in[1]
assign out_both[3] = in[3] & in[2];       // Both in[3] and in[2]

// Assigning out_any based on the condition for each bit and its right neighbor
assign out_any[0] = 1'b0;                  // There's no neighbor to the right for in[0]
assign out_any[1] = in[1] | in[0];        // Any of in[1] or in[0]
assign out_any[2] = in[2] | in[1];        // Any of in[2] or in[1]
assign out_any[3] = in[3] | in[2];        // Any of in[3] or in[2]

// Assigning out_different based on comparing each bit with its left neighbor with wrapping
assign out_different[0] = (in[0] != in[3]); // Compare in[0] and in[3]
assign out_different[1] = (in[1] != in[0]); // Compare in[1] and in[0]
assign out_different[2] = (in[2] != in[1]); // Compare in[2] and in[1]
assign out_different[3] = (in[3] != in[2]); // Compare in[3] and in[2]

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **out_both:** 
   - The first bit (`out_both[0]`) is assigned `0` since `in[0]` has no left neighbor. 
   - The other bits are assigned based on a logical AND of the current bit and its left neighbor.

2. **out_any:** 
   - Similar approach is used where the first bit is assigned `0` since `in[0]` has no right neighbor. 
   - The rest are computed using a logical OR with the right neighbor.

3. **out_different:**
   - Each bit is compared to its left neighbor, wrapping around so that the left neighbor of `in[0]` is `in[3]`.

This module meets the specified requirements and can be synthesized for FPGA or ASIC designs. Make sure to test the module to verify its functionality based on the requirements.
