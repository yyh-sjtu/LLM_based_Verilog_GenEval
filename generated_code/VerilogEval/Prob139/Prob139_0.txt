As a professional RTL designer, I would design the TopModule using a finite state machine to implement the given functionality for controlling the motor. I would start by defining the states and transitions based on the requirements provided.

Here is a high-level description of how I would implement the TopModule:

1. Define the states of the FSM:
   - State A: Beginning state while reset is asserted
   - State B: Waiting for x to produce 1, 0, 1
   - State C: Monitoring y to determine g output

2. Implement the FSM logic:
   - When resetn is asserted, FSM transitions to state A
   - When resetn is de-asserted, FSM transitions to state B after the next clock edge, set f = 1 for one clock cycle
   - In state B, monitor x input to detect 1, 0, 1 sequence. Transition to state C when detected
   - In state C, monitor y input. If y becomes 1 within two clock cycles, set g = 1 permanently. Otherwise, set g = 0 permanently.

3. Implement the RTL code for the TopModule with appropriate signal assignments and state transitions.

I would verify the functionality of the design using simulations and testing to ensure that the FSM operates correctly according to the specified requirements. I would also consider corner cases and edge scenarios to validate the robustness of the design.

Overall, by following a systematic approach to RTL design and verification, I would ensure the TopModule meets the specified functionality and performance requirements for controlling the motor based on the provided FSM behavior.
