As a professional RTL designer, I would start by designing the finite state machine (FSM) based on the provided specifications for the TopModule. Here is a brief description of the states and transitions for the FSM:

State A (Beginning State):
- In State A, the FSM stays as long as the reset input is asserted.

State B (Output f = 1 for one clock cycle):
- Transition from State A to State B: When the reset signal is de-asserted and the next clock edge occurs.
- In State B, output f is set to 1 for one clock cycle.

State C (Monitor x input for 1, 0, 1 pattern):
- Transition from State B to State C: After output f has been set to 1 for a clock cycle.
- In State C, the FSM monitors the x input for the pattern 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles.

State D (Set g = 1):
- Transition from State C to State D: When the x input produces the 1, 0, 1 pattern in three successive clock cycles.
- In State D, output g is set to 1 on the following clock cycle.

State E (Monitor y input for g = 1 maintenance):
- Transition from State D to State E: After g has been set to 1.
- In State E, the FSM monitors the y input. If y becomes 1 within at most two clock cycles, g is maintained at 1 permanently. If y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, g is set to 0 permanently.

I would then proceed to write the Verilog code for implementing the TopModule with the specified FSM behavior, ensuring proper clock and reset synchronization and meeting timing requirements. I would also perform functional verification and simulation to validate the design. Additionally, I would document the module's functionality, states, transitions, and timing requirements for future reference.
