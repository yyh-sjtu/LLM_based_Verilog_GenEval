As a professional RTL designer, I would first create a state machine diagram based on the provided state transitions and state assignments.

State machine diagram:

```
            |----[1]----> B ----[1]----> A
            |               |              |
            A ----[0]----> B ----[0]----> C
            |               |              |
reset -->  |----[0]----> C ----[0]----> E ----[1]----> D ----[0]----> F ----[1]----> C
            |                                                      |              |
            |------------------------------------------------------[1]----> D
```

From the state machine diagram, we can derive the logic equations for Y2 and Y4:

Y2 = y[1]'y[2] + y[0]y[2] + y[0]y[1] = ~y[1]y[2] + y[0]y[2] + y[0]~y[1]
   = y[0]y[2] + y[0]~y[1] + ~y[1]y[2]

Y4 = y[3]'y[4] + y[2]y[4] + y[2]y[3] = ~y[3]y[4] + y[2]y[4] + y[2]~y[3]
   = y[2]y[4] + y[2]~y[3] + ~y[3]y[4]

Based on these logic equations, I would design the TopModule RTL code implementing the state machine with the next-state signals Y2 and Y4 calculated accordingly.
