To implement the module `TopModule` based on the provided state machine and the one-hot encoding for the states, we need to create a structure that captures the behavior of the given state transitions, specifically focusing on two outputs `Y2` and `Y4` based on states represented by `y[1]` and `y[3]`.

### Breakdown of the States and Transitions

The states in one-hot encoding are:

- State A: `y = 000001` (1)
- State B: `y = 000010` (2)
- State C: `y = 000100` (4)
- State D: `y = 001000` (8)
- State E: `y = 010000` (16)
- State F: `y = 100000` (32)

Now let's analyze the state transitions based on the input `w`:

1. **From State A (y[0])**
   - On `w = 0` -> Stay in A
   - On `w = 1` -> Transition to B
   
2. **From State B (y[1])**
   - On `w = 0` -> Transition to C
   - On `w = 1` -> Transition to D

3. **From State C (y[2])**
   - On `w = 0` -> Transition to E
   - On `w = 1` -> Transition to D

4. **From State D (y[3])**
   - On `w = 0` -> Transition to F
   - On `w = 1` -> Transition to A

5. **From State E (y[4])**
   - On `w = 0` -> Stay in E
   - On `w = 1` -> Transition to D

6. **From State F (y[5])**
   - On `w = 0` -> Transition to C
   - On `w = 1` -> Transition to D

### Logic Equations for Y2 and Y4

We will derive the output logic equations for `Y2` and `Y4` based on the specified states (which correspond to `y[1]` and `y[3]`):

- **Y2 (y[1] for state B):**
  - `Y2` is `1` when in state B.
  - So: 
    \[
    Y2 = y[1]
    \]

- **Y4 (y[3] for state D):**
  - `Y4` is `1` when in state D.
  - So: 
    \[
    Y4 = y[3]
    \]

### Verilog Implementation of `TopModule`

Hereâ€™s how you could implement the `TopModule` in Verilog:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [6:0] y, // 7-bit input for states
    input  w,
    output Y1, // Not specified in the problem but must be defined
    output Y2,
    output Y3  // Not specified in the problem but must be defined
);

    // Assign Y2 and Y4 based on the state encoding
    assign Y2 = y[1]; // Is 1 when in state B
    assign Y4 = y[3]; // Is 1 when in state D

   // Note: Y1 and Y3 are not defined in the conditions provided.
   // You may need to define logic based on requirements or context.

endmodule
```

### Summary
- `Y2` reflects whether the system is in state B.
- `Y4` reflects whether the system is in state D.
- The module implements the logic assignation directly from the state encoding with `y[1]` and `y[3]`.
