To implement the TopModule with the provided state machine and one-hot encoding, we can derive the logic equations for Y2 and Y4 as follows:

```
always @(*) begin
    case(y)
        6'b000001: begin // State A
            Y2 = w;
            Y4 = 1'b0;
        end
        6'b000010: begin // State B
            Y2 = 1'b0;
            Y4 = 1'b1;
        end
        6'b000100: begin // State C
            Y2 = w;
            Y4 = 1'b0;
        end
        6'b001000: begin // State D
            Y2 = 1'b0;
            Y4 = 1'b1;
        end
        6'b010000: begin // State E
            Y2 = w;
            Y4 = 1'b1;
        end
        6'b100000: begin // State F
            Y2 = w;
            Y4 = 1'b0;
        end
    endcase
end
```

This logic implements the next-state signals Y2 and Y4 based on the current state stored in the input signal y. The provided state machine transitions are followed according to the one-hot encoding provided. This code should be implemented within the TopModule verilog module along with the input and output ports specified.
