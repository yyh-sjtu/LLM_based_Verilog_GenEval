Here is the RTL code for the TopModule implementing a D flip flop with a positive edge triggered clock and an asynchronous reset signal:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input clk,
    input ar,
    input d,
    output reg q
);

// D flip flop with positive edge-triggered clock and asynchronous reset
always @(posedge clk or posedge ar)
begin
    if(ar)
        q <= 1'b0; // Reset the output q to 0
    else
        q <= d; // Update the output q with the input d on positive clock edge
end

endmodule
```

This code defines a module named TopModule with input ports clk, ar, and d, as well as an output port q. The module implements a D flip flop with a positive edge-triggered clock and an asynchronous reset signal ar. The output q is reset to 0 when ar is active (high) and is updated with the input d on the positive edge of the clock signal.
