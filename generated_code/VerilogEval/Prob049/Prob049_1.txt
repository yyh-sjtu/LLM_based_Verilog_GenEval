Certainly! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that implements a D flip-flop with the specified interface, which includes a clock input, a data input, an output, and an asynchronous reset input.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,   // Clock input
    input  wire ar,    // Asynchronous reset
    input  wire d,     // Data input
    output reg q       // Output
);

    // Asynchronous reset behavior
    always @(*) begin
        if (ar) begin
            q <= 1'b0;  // Reset output to 0
        end else begin
            q <= q;     // Maintain the current state
        end
    end
   
    // Positive edge triggered behavior
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (!ar) begin
            q <= d;      // Capture input 'd' on positive clock edge
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Asynchronous Reset**:
   - The output `q` is reset to `0` whenever `ar` (asynchronous reset) is high, regardless of the clock signal.

2. **Positive Edge Triggered**:
   - On the positive edge of `clk`, if `ar` is low (indicating the reset is not active), the value of `d` is captured and assigned to `q`.

3. **Blocking versus Non-blocking Assignments**:
   - I chose to use `<=` (non-blocking) for the sequential logic to avoid race conditions in simulation and to ensure proper timing behavior during synthesis.

### Notes:
- This simple D flip-flop assumes that `ar` takes precedence over the `clk` signal for resetting the output.
- Make sure to simulate and test the design to confirm the expected behavior.
