Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a module named `TopModule` in Verilog that includes 8 D flip-flops with active high synchronous reset. Each flip-flop takes one bit of the 8-bit input `d` and outputs to the 8-bit output `q`. The output is set to zero on the reset signal.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire       clk,    // Clock input
    input  wire       reset,  // Reset input
    input  wire [7:0] d,      // 8-bit data input
    output reg  [7:0] q       // 8-bit data output
);

    // 8 D Flip-Flops
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
            q <= 8'b00000000;  // Reset output to zero
        end else begin
            q <= d;            // Capture data on clock edge
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Module Definition**: The module is defined with the name `TopModule` and specifies its input/output ports.
   
2. **Clock and Reset Handling**: The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of `clk`. Inside the block:
   - It checks if `reset` is high. If so, `q` is set to zero (`8'b00000000`).
   - If `reset` is not active, the 8-bit data input `d` is assigned to the output `q`.

3. **Assignments**: The assignment to `q` is non-blocking (using `<=`), which is a common practice in sequential logic.

### Synthesis:
This code is synthesizable and can be used in FPGA or ASIC designs. Just make sure to check the toolchain you're using for any specific requirements or syntax nuances.
