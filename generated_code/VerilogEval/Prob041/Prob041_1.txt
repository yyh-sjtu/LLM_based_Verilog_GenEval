Sure! Below is a simple implementation of a module named `TopModule` in Verilog that meets your requirements. It uses eight D flip-flops with active high synchronous reset.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  clk,
    input  reset,
    input  [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] q
);

// D Flip-Flops with synchronous reset
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 8'b0; // Set output to zero on reset
    end else begin
        q <= d; // Capture input d on rising edge of clk
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**:
   - The module is named `TopModule` and has the specified input and output ports.

2. **Input and Output Ports**:
   - `clk`: Clock input, triggered on the rising edge.
   - `reset`: Active high synchronous reset input.
   - `d`: 8-bit data input.
   - `q`: 8-bit output, which holds the current state of the D flip-flops.

3. **Always Block**:
   - The `always` block is sensitive to the positive edge of `clk`.
   - Inside the block, thereâ€™s a check for the `reset` signal:
     - If `reset` is high, the output `q` is set to `0`.
     - If `reset` is low, the output `q` captures the value of `d` on the clock's rising edge.

This implementation provides the functionality required by your specification. If you have any other requirements or questions, feel free to ask!
