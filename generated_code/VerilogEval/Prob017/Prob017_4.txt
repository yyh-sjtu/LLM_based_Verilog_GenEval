Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that performs the function of a 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) for 100-bit input vectors `a` and `b`. The module selects between `a` and `b` based on the value of the `sel` input.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [99:0] a,     // 100-bit input a
    input  [99:0] b,     // 100-bit input b
    input         sel,    // 1-bit select input
    output [99:0] out     // 100-bit output
);

    // Multiplexer Logic
    assign out = (sel == 1'b0) ? a : b;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is named `TopModule` and specifies its inputs and outputs.
2. **Input and Output Ports**:
   - `a` and `b` are 100-bit wide input ports.
   - `sel` is a single-bit select input.
   - `out` is a 100-bit wide output port.
3. **Assign Statement**: The `assign` statement implements the multiplexer logic:
   - If `sel` is `0`, it assigns the `out` to `a`.
   - If `sel` is `1`, it assigns the `out` to `b`.

This MUX effectively selects between the two input vectors based on the value of the `sel` signal. 

### Simulation and Testing
To test this module, you would typically write a testbench that drives signals for `a`, `b`, and `sel` and observes the output `out`. If you're interested in that, please let me know!
