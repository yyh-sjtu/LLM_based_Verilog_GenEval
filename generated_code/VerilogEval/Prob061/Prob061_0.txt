Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as specified in your request. This module includes the necessary inputs and outputs while adhering to the behavior described for a shift register stage. The `clk` input is used to trigger a positive edge clock, and inputs `w`, `R`, `E`, and `L` control the loading and shifting of data.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,  // Clock input
    input  wire w,    // Input from previous stage
    input  wire R,    // Load value input
    input  wire E,    // Enable shift input
    input  wire L,    // Load input
    output reg  Q     // Output value
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (L) begin
            // Load the value R into Q when L is asserted
            Q <= R;
        end else if (E) begin
            // Enable shifting: Shift Q by one position, assuming w is the new bit
            Q <= w;
        end
        // If neither L nor E are asserted, retain the current value of Q
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - `clk`: The clock signal triggers the processes within the module.
   - `w`: The input from the previous stage to be shifted in when enabled.
   - `R`: Represents the data to be loaded into `Q` when `L` is asserted.
   - `E`: When high, indicates the module should shift.
   - `L`: When high, indicates that the module should load the value `R` into the output `Q`.
   - `Q`: The output of the module representing the state of this stage of the shift register.

2. **Behavior**:
   - If `L` is asserted (high), the value of `R` is loaded into `Q`, overriding any existing value.
   - If `L` is not asserted but `E` is asserted, the value from `w` is shifted into `Q`, which is indicative of a shifting operation in the shift register.
   - If neither `L` nor `E` are asserted, `Q` retains its current value.

This implementation allows this module to function as a single stage of an n-bit shift register, and it can be easily instantiated multiple times to create a full shift register system.
