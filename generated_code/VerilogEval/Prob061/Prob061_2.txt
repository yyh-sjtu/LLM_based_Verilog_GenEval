Certainly! Below is a simple RTL implementation for the `TopModule` as specified. This module has the ability to either load a new value, shift a value from the previous stage, or hold its current value based on the input control signals.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk, // Clock input
    input  wire w,   // Input from the previous stage
    input  wire R,   // Value to load (will be treated as the new value)
    input  wire E,   // Enable shift
    input  wire L,   // Load signal
    output reg  Q    // Output value
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (L) begin
            // Load new value R into Q when L is asserted
            Q <= R;
        end else if (E) begin
            // Shift in the value from the previous stage (input w)
            Q <= w;
        end
        // If neither L nor E is asserted, Q retains its current value
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Inputs and Outputs:** 
   - The module has inputs `clk`, `w`, `R`, `E`, `L` and a single output `Q`.
   - All inputs are 1-bit.

2. **Clocking Behavior:**
   - The `always @(posedge clk)` block ensures that the logic inside it is executed on the positive edge of the clock.

3. **Control Logic:**
   - If `L` (Load) is asserted, the output `Q` is loaded with the value from `R`.
   - If `L` is not asserted and `E` (Enable Shift) is asserted, the output `Q` is updated with the value from the previous stage (`w`).
   - If neither `L` nor `E` is asserted, the output `Q` retains its current value.

This basic module is designed to act as a stage in an n-bit shift register where each instance can load a value, shift a value from the previous stage, or hold its current state as dictated by the control signals.
