Certainly! I'll provide you with a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that adheres to the requirements you've specified. This module will function as a one-bit shift register stage and will have the ability to load a value or shift based on the control signals.

Here is the Verilog code for `TopModule`:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire clk,    // Clock input
    input  wire w,      // Input from the previous stage
    input  wire R,      // Value to load (High for load)
    input  wire E,      // Enable shift (High for shifting)
    input  wire L,      // Load signal (High for loading)
    output reg  Q       // Output
);

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (L) begin
            // Load the value R into Q if L is asserted
            Q <= R;
        end else if (E) begin
            // Shift the value from the previous stage if E is asserted
            Q <= w;
        end
        // If neither L nor E are asserted, Q retains its previous value
    end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Port Declarations**: 
   - The inputs include `clk` for the clock, `w` for receiving data from the preceding stage, `R` for the load value, `E` to enable shifting, and `L` to indicate loading.
   - The output `Q` is declared as a register since it will hold its value between clock cycles.

2. **Always Block**:
   - The `always` block is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk`.
   - The first condition checks if `L` (load) is asserted. If it is, the output `Q` is set to the value of `R`.
   - If `L` is not asserted but `E` (enable shift) is, the output `Q` gets updated to the value received from the previous stage (`w`).
   - If neither `L` nor `E` are asserted, the output `Q` retains its previous value (which is the default behavior of registers).

With these features, this module can effectively integrate into a multi-stage shift register circuit, following your specified control signals for loading and shifting data.
