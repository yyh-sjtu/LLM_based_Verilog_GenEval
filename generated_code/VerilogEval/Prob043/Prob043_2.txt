Certainly! Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` that computes the pairwise comparisons of the five 1-bit input signals (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`). The output is a 25-bit vector (`out`), where each bit indicates whether two corresponding bits are equal (1 if equal, 0 if not).

### Verilog Code

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire a,
    input  wire b,
    input  wire c,
    input  wire d,
    input  wire e,
    output wire [24:0] out
);

    // Generate the output
    assign out[24] = (a == a); // comparison of a with a
    assign out[23] = (a == b); // comparison of a with b
    assign out[22] = (a == c); // comparison of a with c
    assign out[21] = (a == d); // comparison of a with d
    assign out[20] = (a == e); // comparison of a with e
    assign out[19] = (b == a); // comparison of b with a
    assign out[18] = (b == b); // comparison of b with b
    assign out[17] = (b == c); // comparison of b with c
    assign out[16] = (b == d); // comparison of b with d
    assign out[15] = (b == e); // comparison of b with e
    assign out[14] = (c == a); // comparison of c with a
    assign out[13] = (c == b); // comparison of c with b
    assign out[12] = (c == c); // comparison of c with c
    assign out[11] = (c == d); // comparison of c with d
    assign out[10] = (c == e); // comparison of c with e
    assign out[9]  = (d == a); // comparison of d with a
    assign out[8]  = (d == b); // comparison of d with b
    assign out[7]  = (d == c); // comparison of d with c
    assign out[6]  = (d == d); // comparison of d with d
    assign out[5]  = (d == e); // comparison of d with e
    assign out[4]  = (e == a); // comparison of e with a
    assign out[3]  = (e == b); // comparison of e with b
    assign out[2]  = (e == c); // comparison of e with c
    assign out[1]  = (e == d); // comparison of e with d
    assign out[0]  = (e == e); // comparison of e with e

endmodule
```

### Explanation
- This module takes five 1-bit inputs: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`.
- The output `out` is a 25-bit vector, where each bit is computed based on the equality of two 1-bit inputs.
- The first comparison is `a` with itself, leading to the last bit of `out` being the comparison of `e` with itself.
- Each output bit is set to 1 (true) if the two signals being compared are equal and 0 (false) otherwise.

### Notes
- The comparisons are organized such that every pair (including self-comparisons) is covered.
- This design is straightforward but may not be the most optimal for larger numbers of inputs. However, for five inputs, it remains clear and easy to understand.
