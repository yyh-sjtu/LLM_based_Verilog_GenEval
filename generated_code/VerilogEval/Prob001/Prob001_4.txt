Certainly! Here is the RTL code for the TopModule that always outputs a LOW:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    output reg zero
);

// Set the output 'zero' to always be LOW
always @* begin
    zero = 1'b0;
end

endmodule
``` 

This module will continuously output a LOW signal on the 'zero' output port. Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications.
