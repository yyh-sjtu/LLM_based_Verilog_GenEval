Below is a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` with the specified interface and functionality. The module performs a bitwise OR between two 3-bit inputs, calculates their logical OR, and produces the NOT of both inputs in a 6-bit output as required.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [2:0] a,              // 3-bit input a
    input  [2:0] b,              // 3-bit input b
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise, // 3-bit output for bitwise OR
    output       out_or_logical,  // 1-bit output for logical OR
    output [5:0] out_not         // 6-bit output for NOT of both inputs
);

    // Bitwise OR of a and b
    assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;

    // Logical OR of a and b
    assign out_or_logical = |(a) | |(b);  // Logical OR: true if any bit in a or b is high

    // NOT of a and b, with b in upper half and a in lower half
    assign out_not = {~b, ~a};

endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - `a` and `b` are 3-bit input vectors.
   - `out_or_bitwise` is a 3-bit output that contains the bitwise OR of `a` and `b`.
   - `out_or_logical` is a single-bit output representing the logical OR of `a` and `b`.
   - `out_not` is a 6-bit output where the upper half contains the NOT of `b` and the lower half contains the NOT of `a`.

2. **Operations:**
   - **Bitwise OR Operation:** `out_or_bitwise = a | b`. This computes the OR operation bit by bit.
   - **Logical OR Operation:** `out_or_logical = |(a) | |(b)` uses the reduction operator `|` to evaluate if any bit in `a` or `b` is high. If at least one bit is high in either vector, the result is `1`, otherwise `0`.
   - **NOT Operation:** `out_not = {~b, ~a}` takes the bitwise NOT of both inputs. The result is a concatenation where the NOT of `b` occupies the upper three bits and the NOT of `a` occupies the lower three bits.

This simple and clear design can be synthesized and instantiated in larger digital designs.
