Here is a Verilog implementation of the TopModule module:

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [2:0] a,
    input [2:0] b,
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
    output out_or_logical,
    output [5:0] out_not
);

assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;
assign out_or_logical = |{a,b};
assign out_not = ~{b,a};

endmodule
```

In this implementation, the bitwise-OR of inputs a and b is computed using the OR operator '|'. The logical-OR of a and b is computed using the concatenation operator '{}' followed by the OR operator '|'. The inverse (NOT) of both a and b is computed using the bitwise negation operator '~' followed by the concatenation operator '{}'.
