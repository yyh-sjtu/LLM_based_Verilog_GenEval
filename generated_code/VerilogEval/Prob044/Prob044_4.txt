Sure! Below is the Verilog code for the `TopModule` that meets the specified requirements. This module takes in two 3-bit inputs, performs the bitwise OR, logical OR, and computes the NOT of both inputs as described.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  wire [2:0] a,              // 3-bit input a
    input  wire [2:0] b,              // 3-bit input b
    output wire [2:0] out_or_bitwise, // 3-bit output for bitwise OR
    output wire out_or_logical,       // 1-bit output for logical OR
    output wire [5:0] out_not         // 6-bit output for NOT
);

// Bitwise OR of the two 3-bit inputs
assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;

// Logical OR of the two vectors; a logical OR returns 1 if any bit is 1
assign out_or_logical = |(a | b);

// NOT operation
assign out_not[5:3] = ~b; // Upper half: NOT of b
assign out_not[2:0] = ~a; // Lower half: NOT of a

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Bitwise OR**: The expression `a | b` computes the bitwise OR of the two 3-bit inputs. This result is assigned to `out_or_bitwise`.
  
2. **Logical OR**: The logical OR operation is performed using the bitwise OR, followed by a reduction OR operator `|`, which checks if any bits in the result are high (1). If any of the bits of either `a` or `b` are high, `out_or_logical` will be set to 1.

3. **NOT Operation**: The NOT operation is performed separately for both inputs. The upper half of the `out_not` output (`out_not[5:3]`) holds the inverted values of `b`, while the lower half (`out_not[2:0]`) holds the inverted values of `a`.

You can use this module in your design by instantiating it and connecting the inputs and outputs as required.
