Hereâ€™s a Verilog implementation of the `TopModule` as per your requirements. This module takes two 3-bit inputs, computes their bitwise OR, logical OR, and NOT operation, and organizes the outputs accordingly.

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input  [2:0] a,                // 3-bit input a
    input  [2:0] b,                // 3-bit input b
    output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,    // 3-bit output for bitwise OR
    output       out_or_logical,     // 1-bit output for logical OR
    output [5:0] out_not            // 6-bit output for NOT (upper half for b, lower half for a)
);

    // Bitwise OR of inputs a and b
    assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;

    // Logical OR of inputs a and b
    assign out_or_logical = |(a) | |(b);  // Logical OR by checking if any bit is high

    // NOT operation on both inputs
    assign out_not = {~b, ~a};  // Concatenate NOT of b (upper half) and NOT of a (lower half)

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Ports**:
   - `a` and `b` are defined as 3-bit wide input ports.
  
2. **Output Ports**:
   - `out_or_bitwise`: This 3-bit output represents the bitwise OR of `a` and `b`.
   - `out_or_logical`: This 1-bit output represents the logical OR (if any bit in `a` or `b` is high).
   - `out_not`: This 6-bit output contains the NOT of `b` in the upper 3 bits and the NOT of `a` in the lower 3 bits.

3. **Assignments**:
   - The bitwise OR (`|`) is computed directly between `a` and `b`.
   - The logical OR uses reduction OR (`|`) operator to collapse `a` and `b` and checks if any bit is non-zero.
   - The NOT operation is performed using the negation operator (`~`). The result is concatenated to ensure the output format is as specified.

This implementation encapsulates the required functionality within a single module while adhering to the interface you provided.
