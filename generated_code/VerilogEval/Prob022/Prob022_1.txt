Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog, which matches the interface you've specified:

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input wire a,    // Input a
    input wire b,    // Input b
    input wire sel,  // Selector input
    output wire out  // Output
);

    // Mux functionality implementation
    assign out = (sel) ? b : a;

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs**: `a` and `b` are the data inputs, while `sel` is the select signal that determines which input to pass to the output.
- **Output**: `out` is the output of the multiplexer.
- **Behavior**: The `assign` statement uses a conditional (ternary) operator. If `sel` is low (`0`), it outputs `a`, and if `sel` is high (`1`), it outputs `b`.

### Usage
Make sure to instantiate this `TopModule` in your testbench or higher-level design as needed. You can simulate and verify its functionality to ensure it behaves as expected.
