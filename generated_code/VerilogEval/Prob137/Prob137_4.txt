As a professional RTL designer, I would start by defining the states of the finite state machine required to correctly receive and verify bytes in the given serial protocol. The states could include IDLE, START_BIT, RECEIVE_DATA, and VERIFY_STOP_BIT.

I would then create a state register to hold the current state and a next state logic block to determine the next state based on the current state and input signals. The input signals to consider would be the input data 'in', the clock 'clk', and the active-high synchronous reset 'reset'.

Next, I would implement the logic for each state transition, ensuring that the FSM correctly identifies the start bit, receives all 8 data bits, and verifies the stop bit. If the stop bit is incorrect or missing, the FSM should wait until it finds the correct stop bit before moving on to the next byte.

I would also include a 'done' output signal that goes high when a complete byte has been received and verified. This signal can be used to indicate to the external logic that a byte is ready to be processed.

Finally, I would simulate the design using a testbench to verify that the FSM behaves as expected in all scenarios and meets the requirements of correctly receiving and verifying bytes in the given serial protocol.
