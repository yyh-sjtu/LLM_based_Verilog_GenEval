module utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to detect the start bit, read the data bits, and verify the stop bit.

Hereâ€™s how the design is structured:
1. **States**:
   - `IDLE`: The state waiting for a start bit.
   - `RECEIVE`: The state where data bits are received.
   - `WAIT_STOP`: The state waiting for the stop bit after data reception.

2. **State Transition**:
   - The FSM transitions from `IDLE` to `RECEIVE` upon detecting a start bit (logic 0).
   - It then transitions to `WAIT_STOP` after receiving 8 data bits.
   - Finally, it checks for the stop bit while in `WAIT_STOP`.

3. **Output**:
   - The output `done` becomes high when a complete byte is successfully received.

Here is the SystemVerilog implementation:

```systemverilog
module TopModule (
    input  logic clk,
    input  logic reset,
    input  logic in,
    output logic done
);
    // State Encoding
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {
        IDLE = 2'b00,
        RECEIVE = 2'b01,
        WAIT_STOP = 2'b10
    } state_t;

    // Internal variables
    state_t state, next_state;
    logic [7:0] data; // To hold the data
    logic [3:0] bit_count; // To count received bits
    
    // Sequential block for state transitions and done signal
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= IDLE;
            done <= 1'b0;
            bit_count <= 4'b0000;
        end else begin
            state <= next_state;
            if (next_state == WAIT_STOP && bit_count == 4'b1000) begin
                done <= 1'b1; // Set done if we are transitioning to WAIT_STOP
            end else begin
                done <= 1'b0; // Reset done otherwise
            end
        end
    end

    // Combinational block for next state logic
    always_comb begin
        next_state = state; // Default to hold the current state

        case (state)
            IDLE: begin
                if (in == 1'b0) begin // Start bit detected
                    next_state = RECEIVE;
                    bit_count = 4'b0000; // Reset bit count
                end
            end
            
            RECEIVE: begin
                if (bit_count < 4'b1000) begin // Receive 8 bits
                    bit_count = bit_count + 1;
                end else begin
                    next_state = WAIT_STOP; // Move to waiting for stop
                end
            end

            WAIT_STOP: begin
                if (in == 1'b1) begin // Stop bit detected
                    next_state = IDLE; // Go back to IDLE
                end else if (in == 1'b0) begin
                    // Still in WAIT_STOP until the correct stop bit is found.
                    // No state change.
                end
            end

            default: next_state = IDLE; // Default safety state
        endcase
    end
endmodule
