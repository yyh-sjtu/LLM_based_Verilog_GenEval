I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input clk
 - input in      (8 bits)
 - input anyedge (8 bits)

Implement a module that for each bit in an 8-bit input vector, detect
when the input signal changes from one clock cycle to the next (detect
any edge). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1
transition occurs. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.
