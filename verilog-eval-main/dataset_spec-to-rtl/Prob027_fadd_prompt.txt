I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  cin
 - output cout
 - output sum

The module should impement a full adder. A full adder adds three bits
(including carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.
