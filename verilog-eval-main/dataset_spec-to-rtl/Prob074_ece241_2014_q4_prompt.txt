I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  x
 - output z

The module should implement a finite state machine with the following
behavior. Input x goes to three different two-input gates: an XOR, an
AND, and a OR gate. Each of the three gates is connected to the input of
a D flip-flop and then the flip-flop outputs all go to a three-input
XNOR, whose output is Z. The second input of the XOR is its corresponding
flip-flop's output, the second input of the AND is its corresponding
flip-flop's complemented output, and finally the second input of the OR
is its corresponding flip-flop's complementary output.

Assume that the D flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the
machine begins. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive
edge of the clock.
