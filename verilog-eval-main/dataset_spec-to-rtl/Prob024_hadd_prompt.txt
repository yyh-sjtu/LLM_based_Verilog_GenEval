I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output sum
 - output cout

The module should implement a half adder. A half adder adds two bits
(with no carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.
