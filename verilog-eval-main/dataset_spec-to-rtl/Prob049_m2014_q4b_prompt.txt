I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  ar
 - input  d
 - output q

The module should implement a D flip flop, positive edge triggered, with
an asynchronous reset "ar".
