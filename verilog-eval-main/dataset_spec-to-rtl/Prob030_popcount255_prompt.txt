I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  in  (255 bits)
 - output out (  8 bits)

A "population count" circuit counts the number of '1's in an input
vector. The module should implement a population count circuit for a
255-bit input vector.
