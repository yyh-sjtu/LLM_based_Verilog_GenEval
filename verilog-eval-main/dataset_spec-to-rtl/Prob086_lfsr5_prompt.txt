I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (5 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed
with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR
can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits
cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is
never reached).

The module should implement a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps
at bit positions 5 and 3. The active-high synchronous reset should reset
the LFSR output to 1. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.
