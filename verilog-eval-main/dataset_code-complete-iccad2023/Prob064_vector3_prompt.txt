Given several input vectors, concatenate them together then split them up
into several output vectors. There are six 5-bit input vectors: a, b, c,
d, e, and f, for a total of 30 bits of input. There are four 8-bit output
vectors: w, x, y, and z, for 32 bits of output. The output should be a
concatenation of the input vectors followed by two 1 bits (the two 1 bits
should be in the LSB positions).
