Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with interesting
properties (such as being Turing-complete). There is a one-dimensional
array of cells (on or off). At each time step, the state of each cell
changes. In Rule 110, the next state of each cell depends only on itself
and its two neighbours, according to the following table:

  Left | Center | Right | Center's next state
  1    | 1      | 1     | 0
  1    | 1      | 0     | 1
  1    | 0      | 1     | 1
  1    | 0      | 0     | 0
  0    | 1      | 1     | 1
  0    | 1      | 0     | 1
  0    | 0      | 1     | 1
  0    | 0      | 0     | 0

In this circuit, create a 512-cell system (q[511:0]), and advance by one
time step each clock cycle. The synchronous active high load input
indicates the state of the system should be loaded with data[511:0].
Assume the boundaries (q[-1] and q[512]) are both zero (off).
