Given the finite state machine circuit described below, assume that the D
flip-flops are initially reset to zero before the machine begins.

Build this circuit in Verilog.

Input x goes to three different two-input gates: a XOR, an AND, and a OR
gate. Each of the three gates is connected to the input of a D flip-flop
and then the flip-flop outputs all go to a three-input XNOR, whose output
is Z. The second input of the XOR is its corresponding flip-flop's
output, the second input of the AND is its corresponding flip-flop's
complemented output, and finally the second input of the OR is its
corresponding flip-flop's complementary output.
