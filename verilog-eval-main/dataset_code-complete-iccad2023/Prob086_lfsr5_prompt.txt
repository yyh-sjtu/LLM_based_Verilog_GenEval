A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed
with the output bit to produce its next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift. If the taps positions are carefully chosen, the LFSR
can be made to be "maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits
cycles through 2**n-1 states before repeating (the all-zero state is
never reached). Build a 5-bit maximal-length Galois LFSR with taps at bit
positions 5 and 3. The active-high synchronous reset should reset the
LFSR output to 1.
