Build a circuit that has one 3-bit input, then outputs the same vector,
and also splits it into three separate 1-bit outputs. Connect output o0
to the input vector's position 0, o1 to position 1, etc.

module TopModule (
  input [2:0] vec,
  output [2:0] outv,
  output o2,
  output o1,
  output o0
);
