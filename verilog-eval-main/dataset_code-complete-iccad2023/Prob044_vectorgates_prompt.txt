Build a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of
the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT)
of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not
(i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.

module TopModule (
  input [2:0] a,
  input [2:0] b,
  output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
  output out_or_logical,
  output [5:0] out_not
);
