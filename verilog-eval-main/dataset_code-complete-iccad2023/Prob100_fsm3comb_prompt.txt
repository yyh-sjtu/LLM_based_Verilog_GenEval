The following is the state transition table for a Moore state machine
with one input, one output, and four states. Use the following state
encoding: A=2'b00, B=2'b01, C=2'b10, D=2'b11.Implement only the state
transition logic and output logic (the combinational logic portion) for
this state machine. Given the current state (state), compute the
next_state and output (out) based on the state transition table.

  State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
  A     | A, B                             | 0
  B     | C, B                             | 0
  C     | A, D                             | 0
  D     | C, B                             | 1
