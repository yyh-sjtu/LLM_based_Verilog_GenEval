For each bit in an 8-bit vector, detect when the input signal changes
from 0 in one clock cycle to 1 the next (similar to positive edge
detection). The output bit should be set the cycle after a 0 to 1
transition occurs.

module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] in,
  output reg [7:0] pedge
);
