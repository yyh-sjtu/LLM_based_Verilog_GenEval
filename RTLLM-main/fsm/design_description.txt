Please act as a professional verilog designer.

Implement a Mealy FSM detection circuit that detects a single-bit input IN. When the input is 10011, output MATCH is 1, and MATCH is 0 in other cases. Support for continuous input and loop detection. 

Module name:  
    fsm               
Input ports:
    IN: Input signal to the FSM.
    CLK: Clock signal used for synchronous operation.
    RST: Reset signal to initialize the FSM.
Output ports:
    MATCH: Output signal indicating a match condition based on the FSM state.

Implementation:
The module implements an FSM detection.
On every change in the input signal (IN) or positive edge of CLK or RST, if RST is active, the output signal MATCH is set to 0.
If the sequence of inputs IN is 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, the MATCH signal is 1 at the same time as the last occurrence of IN=1. If the sequence of inputs IN is 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, the MATCH signal becomes 1 at the fifth and ninth of IN; otherwise, it is set to 0.
