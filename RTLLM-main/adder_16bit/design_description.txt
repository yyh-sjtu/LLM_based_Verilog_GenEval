Please act as a professional verilog designer.

Implement a module of a 16-bit full adder in combinational logic.

Module name:  
    adder_16bit               
Input ports:
    a[15:0]: 16-bit input operand A.
    b[15:0]: 16-bit input operand B.
    Cin: Carry-in input.
Output ports:
    y[15:0]: 16-bit output representing the sum of A and B.
    Co: Carry-out output.

Implementation:
In the adder_16bit module, you need to design a small bit-width adder(8-bit adder), which will be instantiated multiple times.

Give me the complete code.
